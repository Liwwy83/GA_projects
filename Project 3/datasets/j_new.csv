0,LearnJapanese,matt vs japan operation uproot initiation video matt recently released his initiation video for his whole uproot sham basically whole video is just him and ken making it sound like hell if you miss out on the course and doing scare tactics to try to get you to buy it towards the end they bring up a refund policy saying that theyll refund all your money within a year if you were dissatisfied ken then mentioned that if you do the whole course remember that within  days and are dissatisfied  theyll even pay you  this even sounds like a blatant scam but after saying this he then elaborates on the whole course thing saying you have to be at every single live and do all the stuff in order to be eligible for that sounds like a complete scam and has all the signs of one not saying the course is going to be bad necessarily but probably not worth the money when theyre just gonna give you an in depth pitch accent course with  hours of useless matt qampa and whatever other stuff they decide to throw in whereas you could probably even more in depth and accurate pitch accent  pronunciation course by dogen on patreon for just  a month your money though

what about grammar do you have any resources to do exercises apart from workbooks for specific textbooks  maybe you also make a card with several sentences or do you just wait until it comes up naturally and memorise it then and there"

7,LearnJapanese,"my intermediate experiences after a long break like years from japanese learning although within that time ive always been watching anime and jdrama albeit with subtitles i decided to get back on the saddle during the first year of covid since you know we were all stuck at home

apart from grinding mostly anki decks and memrise i also did a lot of input it was pretty much a daily routine of study in the day and input at night shows jyoutube news podcasts music books manga whatever i could get my hands on that interested me

after a year of that i was pretty much able to consume native content with about  comprehension and it felt great and then of course came the infamous intermediate wall reading lots of posts and experiences here i decided to switch things up a bit

firstly i stopped with all the flashcards it just wasnt helping anymore and it felt tiresome its funny where you reach a certain point when you come across a new word you look it up once and you know it because it pops up again and again due to the type of content you consume like native english speakers just look up a word in the dictionary they dont know they just know it after that without having to use flashcards

next i read up on more intermediate textslessons mostly on grammar  stuff like dictionary of japanese grammar tobira making sense of japanese grammar and so on even revisiting basic grammar concepts from time to time

finally i switched to a different grind  kanshudo they have amazing structures and levels of kanji grammar vocabulary even for advanced levels their games are so intuitive and you get the feedback instantly and can dive into any part of the language especially when getting wrong answers every word kanji grammar point is clickable and all the explanations pop up on the same page they have revamped their intermediate course and i hope to clear the entire thing in the next few months

so i still study in the day i work at home so i do bits here and there in between tasks on my job lunch time etc and input at night youtube podcasts etc 

now i find that i can comprehend native content faster i read faster and get deeper understanding like for books and websites i used to skim over the grammar points quickly to the point of ignoring sometimes as i would look mostly at keywords to understand the gistcontext now i read texts more fully and faster on web pages i still use yomichan but i hover over the unfamiliar words for like a second or two at most just to get the pronunciation and meaning

oh i also picked up a little side hobby of fansubbing jdrama 

in conclusion language learning is really a journey and you may have to take different paths along the way im not saying what works for me will be the same for everyone else but its good to experiment and see what works best for you"

13,LearnJapanese,"which is the best app i could use to learn japanese first of all i feel obligated to say that english is not my main language my language has a ton of sounds according to an english teacher i had which makes it easy for us to copyimitate other accents on top of that my country has been involved with japan many years ago even though were so far apart and its noticeable in some events dedicated to my country as well as some pastries which are original from here and there are some japanese words which originated in my country

my point is that im not too focused on the speakinglistening exercises maybe in the future but not right now

anyway duolingo has been great for this cause they have an option to skip those kinds of exercises i had learned hiragana and katakana and was able to read quite fast then i started the lessons and everything was going fine until they introduced kanji all of a sudden without even teaching it or having an option to learn it individually first like the other two

i got so discouraged by this i ended up stopping my studies but i am trying to get my life back on track and im making my own schedule with time to study all the things that i needwant to learn

japanese is one of those i already know  languages including mine but i honestly love the fact that i can speak english so well so yeah i want to learn more languages at least japanese

i feel like im wasting my senseis time because i really do suck terribly at speaking japaneseits like everything i learn flies out the window when i open my mouth because i just cant think fast enough to form correct sentences comprehension is difficult too and i often miss what my sensei means causing confusion im a busy person like all of us im sure and i dont have the time to study everyday for multiple hours but im enjoying learning at my own slow pace its everyday learning but i dont spend much time per day i feel like my sensei wants me to pick up the pace and i understand where shes coming from but i find it so hard to fit in more than i already am i get so discouraged after my lesson and i find i almost dread them each weekits like despite my consistent learning effort i log on for class only to mess up every sentence that i already studied i also often forget to have done at least some of the homework my sensei asks of me its humiliating and frustrating and i wonder if im getting as much out of a paid lesson as i should be i also dont have much money and the lesson fees do weigh on my mind not that theyre exorbitant

for my case should i perhaps try selfstudy i was successful in selfstudy for two months in the past but i eventually gave up i have all the materials but id feel guilty quitting my class    im sure having a weekly japanese lesson helps with japanese aquisition overall though like i said i wonder if its maybe not for me and that im not getting what i should out of it what do you guys think"

 open the deck with fuzzyanki  fuzzyanki fasihagithubio gt voila now your deck is in html and you can use yomichan with it you can even save the html so you can use it offline make sure to open the deck with pictures  might take a few dozen seconds

to get the audio you need to import the deck into anki probably best to start with a new profile so you dont muck up your regular one once you import it you can open your anki media folder on pc its cusersusernameappdataroamingankiankinamecollectionmedia and copy your audio files to a different folder of your choice 

note as a cleaner approach to  above you can first open the deck in a temporary anki profile delete unneeded fields then export the deck before starting with  above

 use resonic player  resonic  a fast audio player and sample manager  to easily play the audiofiles while you scroll through the hugely long web page generated by fuzzyanki if you find something you want to save to anki with yomichan you can simply drag the audio file into anki you can even drag the image from the html file into anki as well

23,LearnJapanese,"the real infection in my opinion so at this point everyone knows about matt vs japans new ahem project claiming theres an infection that ruins peoples japanese and providing a course to fix it upon watching the intro video as well as observing other behaviors in matt and some learners in his communitiesother adjacent japanese learning communities ive realized that maybe there really is an infection going around  but its not pitch accent mistakes or anything like that

its the mindset towards japanese that causes people to become so concerned about their every little flaw and mistake learning speed etc that they miss the entire point of learning the language  for fun enjoyment connection and expanding ones world 

unbeknownst to most people when we learn anything we dont only learn the object of study were immediately focused on our brain also takes in and memorizes the beliefs and emotions we are feeling as we are studying the thing please take a moment and let that sink in

our brains literally internalize not only the piece of information itself but the feelings we had while we were memorizing that piece of information

so take someone who has fully adopted the kind of mindset i describe above  they avoid speaking to japanese people until they feel like they can sound just like a native fueling feelings of avoidance and insecurity about their speaking before they even start they feel like they have to learn japanese as quickly as possible and any perceived threat to this need for speed as they study triggers underlying feelings of discomfort anxiousness and selfcriticism about being too slow maybe theyre not reading as fast as they think they should so they force themselves to read faster even though it feels uncomfortableunnatural for their level and less fun maybe they feel that they are in competition with other learners so they do things like try to force  hours of japanese study a day or overload their anki with too many words causing feelings of impatience frustration and sometimes even burnout 

and all the while their brainbody is associating all those unpleasant feelings with japanese itself their whole experience of the language eventually becomes a mindgame of constant struggle against an imaginary concept of perfection

isnt that such a tragedy isnt it sad that a language that so many people started learning in order to have fun and expand their world is becoming poisoned with very unfun and isolating feelings due to toxic mindsets and beliefs youve unwittingly adopted thats the true infection

and im not saying matt is the sole cause of it there are so many factors that can come into play to make people this way with japanese  perhaps past experiences in school competing for high grades being taught to prioritize achievement rather than enjoyment the list goes on but id propose that matt and many other learners who do or dont follow him may be infected in this way and spreading it to others unknowingly

so id urge everyone here to consider these questions

 what did you originally want to learn japanese for im not talking just practical purposes here like a job or school what about it made you excited or thrilled or interested in this specific language 
 do you still feel strongly connected to those original motivations every time you study or most times
 if not what drives your learning now have you become driven by some mildtovery anxious or obsessive need to dominate the language become perfect or be better than others at it have you perhaps become lost in some competitive numbersgame 
 if so what would it mean to forget about all of that and return to your original motivation no matter what anyone else might think how might your feelingstate as you studied become different if you did return to simpler more authentic motivations

you dont have to answer the questions here or anything i just wanted to give some food for thought and reflection feel free to share any thoughts you have on this topic and thanks for reading"

unless you plan to live in japan dont bother to learn kanji

if youre only wanting to watch anime or japanese movies you dont need to learn how to read

this advice coming from people with high proficiency and the comments were agreeing with them am i crazy to think this is wrong i very clearly remember whenever chinese beginners would join our class theyd always try to learn the pinyin first and then proceed with the characters and then the intonation but thats a very bad idea because its best for you to learn the word and have your brain associate it with a specific image and pronunciation in the long run i understand kanji might be hard from what ive been told harder than chinese characters but i still feel like practice and constantly using them is the only thing that make them easier to use also dissociating a language that is so present in its alphabet is a little odd

52,LearnJapanese,"somewhat common misconceptions on japanese grammar  ive noticed a few posts here over the last couple days of views that are shared by others about japanese grammar that at the end of the day are wrong i thought i would collect and clarify them into a single post

adj are just nouns

i believe this one comes from the fact they are classified as adjectivalnouns in english or maybe theres a popular resource out there that teaches this as well if there is please share but adj are very much a separate classification from nouns the japanese word for them is  combining  the word for english adjectives and adj in japanese and  meaning verb from this it might be more correct to say that they are adjectivalverbs rather than nouns now there are two bits of clarification i feel it is necessary to address as well first it is true that even in japan some scholars think they should be thought of as an offshoot of nouns however that is just one of multiple stances additionally it is true that the oldest forms of adj  and  adj do come from a nouna copula however even in the classical sense and especially now they have evolved to have their own unique conjugation that separates them from nouns that is probably obvious to everyone though lol in any case japanese students do not learn that  are nouns in native classes but their own separate type of word for all intents and purposes it is best to think of it similarly to native students and classify adj as its own part of speech separate from nouns given their unique role and conjugation rules though knowing where a lot came from can be a fun fact

there are no conjugations in japanese

this one seems to have been populated by cure dolly perhaps it is just a misconstruction of what she says i have never seen any of her content myself it came out past my time but this is untrue japanese very much has conjugations like my last clarification i will focus this on how the japanese language itself talks about its language first it is true that there is no conjugation or  conjugation of japanese both  and  are what are known as auxiliary verbs that simply attach to conjugations of the verb however it is very much true that verbs and adjectives have conjugations there are five that appear in presentday japanese and  for the verb  in that order the conjugations would be and  you may notice that  is listed twice for both  and  in older japanese this distinction was important for some types of verbs but we do see a distinction in these types when we refer to adj conjugations  would be  attached directly to nouns and  would be  ends the sentence now this is admittedly different to how most foreignlanguage textbooks would teach japanese conjugations but it is very clear that these verb conjugations exist and every form a verb can take consists of taking one of these five forms and adding auxiliary verbs or other parts of speech things like sentenceending particles to the end of it however i think it is also interesting to note that teaching that  and  are types of conjugations can make concepts like form easier to grasp strictly speaking the form is the  of a verb  the particle  so  which is  however things have obviously been slurred these days and now we have consistent but separate rules on how to get to form or form or whatever have you teaching these five conjugations and auxiliary verbs makes japanese make a whole lot of sense for most things but with form it may add extra confusion or encourage students to say  something that no one has probably uttered in a sentence since the th century anyway the last bit is just my personal opinion and maybe a bit of a justification for the traditional english way of teaching it im expecting many may find this way easier to think about and disagree with me

anyway i just thought these two things deserved a proper explanation  "

we also offer weekly game nights karaoke book club and movieanime watching with lots more social events to come we have an amazing moderating team who listens to wishes for future events theyre always ready and do an amazing job in protecting and serving the community

lastly we also offer a japanese language section where no matter your skill level you can come practice your japanese and freely ask questions to further help your studies we are also looking into making study groups for those who really wish to have a partner  and probably more  for that extra boost to pick up the study book and improve well be making groups for beginners advancedbeginners intermediate advancedintermediate and expert however to take part in these study groups will demand a lot of selfdiscipline as your study mates will depend on you this is still in the process of being made however we hope to add this feature soon

is this a particular form of the word   and if so is there a dictionary that shows up these kinds of difference  jishoorg doesnt seem to show it

is this a part of a general pattern of word transformation  for example i noticed that when   in s e says im going to kill them all  it sounds like he pronounces it   rather than  which i would expect  and my supposition is that theres something about gangsterspeak that must transform  to   the  to an   though maybe im wrong about this too  perhaps there really is a verb  that i just dont know about"

89,LearnJapanese,"dont join any japanese language learning communities if youre a beginneractually want to learn disclamer atm i have no way to prove my japanese proficiency other than for you guys to believe that i passed an n practice test and am planning on taking it this summer in japan take everything i say with a grain of salt bc it really is just my opinion

hear me out when i say this because i think it has a lot of meaning to it 

unless all you are doing is asking a question and getting out there is no reason to be in any of those communities if your goal is to learn and here is why 

when youre first starting outor at any point you dont need to be optimizing how much youre on anki how much youre reading every day documenting how many words you read from each ln etc it has no meaning for the average learner you and me language learning shouldnt become a type of speedrun but really it should be a journey in which you enjoy yourself the hours on those discordor reddit servers lurking around talking to other english speaking people using bad japanese and trying to optimize your learning will be much better used actually just being in japanese 

ok dont get me wrong the people that are speedrunning japanese will probably get a high level of reading proficiency really fast and thats great however you will know much more about the culture have more natural japanese and didnt contemplate suicide  times a week on the way there 

this whole post was really inspired by the fact that i just went into a server spoke to some people in japanese while playing genshin and i got asked how many hours do you immerse everyday how often do you speak japanese how many hours a day do you read japanese a ridiculous amount of times why has language learning become an achievement board that youre trying to fill 

if im being honest ive never timed myself on anything other than reading and thats when i only have a limited amount of time before schoolsomething

instead of those discordreddit servers what should i be using 

well i would recommend hello talk or see if you have any local language exchange classesprograms i actually managed to start one where i live so if you have a local japanese business i would recommend talking to them 

i have been on both sides of this coin and trust me when i say that when you just come away from the toxic speedrunning communities and let yourself just enjoy japanese things will go alot better"

92,LearnJapanese,"nihongo no mori jlpt n n n online course 

nihongo no mori recently launched a fully online jlpt nn course they did a whole series of livestreams in november and december to show off their revamped website n was launched in november although n and n were not available back then n is now available but n is still under development no mention of a release date

it costs  yen per month with a  yen registration fee the subscription covers all  levels

ive looked at the sample videos for n only and it looks good if youre familiar with nihongo no mori on youtube you know theyre pretty good  this content seems to be entirely new and only available on their subscription website 

the course is categorized into vocabulary grammar reading comprehension listening comprehension and mock exams they provide apps to take the course on your devices they also have their own custom made text books which are accessible if you subscribe

i like how yuka sensei breaks down complicated kanji into its radicals and many resemble katakana characters and she creates mnemonics around them to help you memorize their meanings

if youre seriously going for nn this could be a useful but not cheap resource i dont think this is worth it just to get n considering theres hundreds of videos to work through lots of exercises and trial exams plus your own revision time youll probably need to stay subscribed for several months or more so do factor that into your costs

i first started training my reading speed by playing games and watching movies my brain seems able to skim over the words and process the knowledge because the words arent on the screen for very long however when it comes to words on a page the skill just doesnt translate i try to skim over sentences as i would with a subtitle but it just doesnt sink in even when im engrossed in a book i enjoy the reading but it takes me forever 

i do regularly forget kanji readings but in almost all cases i understand the meaning of the kanji or can guess it from context so i dont think thats what is slowing me down but it might be
