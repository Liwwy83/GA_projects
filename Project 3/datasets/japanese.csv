should i read genki  after japanese for busy people  or jump straight to tobira 
"mangastory books suitable for new learners ive learnt english mostly thanks to story bookssherlock holmes hardy boys famous five etc and i wanted to replicate this while learning japanese i wanted to know if anyone knew of any good books that are easy to find in usai live in seattle so its easy for me to get to a kinokuniya 

ive completed my n so i do have a grasp over the basics so i may not need furigana for the most common kanji however i would appreciate them   
an example of a book id like to read is chis sweet home or kitty detectives but i cant find them cheap anywhere   


also ive found yotsubato on amazona  book for  how suitable is it for my level it comes fairly quick and it seemed fun"
"why i want to learn japanese i was born bilingual my family is italian but i grew up in the netherlands i tend to consume tons of english media so my english is good too

im not interested in going to other european countries i have no reason to move to spain france germany etc but i also understand quite well the languages of all those countries except german which is a little bit difficult i literally understand every single word when reading of course i cant speak those languages perfectly but to me they feel more like a different dialect of the languages i already know rather than a different language they feel a little bit like sardinian and sicilian i understand them when i hear them but i cant speak sardinian or sicilian one should also consider that people from nordic countries tend to have perfect english skills so my interest in learning the languages of those people really shrinks

so why do i want to learn japanese  its because ive always devoured tons and tons of media and information about japan its not just anime i dont even watch anime anymore except for jojo and gto which ive watchedrewatched recently lol i read so much stuff about the history the culture and i love their mindset and way of expressing themselves as an european citizen i dont need to move to a different country because of economical reason im even staying in italy and not the netherlands despite the fact salaries are way lower solely because i prefer the lifestyle here more japanese is the only country i really dream and yes i know they tend to be racist and overwork but the positive factors put those negative elements into shadow

we all know japanese is super difficult id say it feels impossible most of the time for me and we may learn  languages in the time we dedicate to japanese but i also think learning such a different language helps you train your brain

and what do you guys think can you relate to my motivations if the answer is no why did you choose to learn the language"

"i finished the japanese tree on duolingo last night i have many tips and suggestions for those wishing to do likewise in the new year i posted an identical post on languagelearning but because this community does not allow crossposts but this is highly relevant i thought id just manually post it again

after  days of practice i finally finished the japanese tree on duolingo i cant say that i was an everyday studier as there were certainly some weeks where i was simply reviewing basic lessons to keep the streak going but in the end the daily push that duolingo existed helped me make it to the end i also dont have all the tree gilded although ive got most of it to at least  crowns and maintained much of what i learned through study methods i detail below

so now heres my review of the tree i think its a very useful tool for learning japanese im already very fluent in chinese so kanji was never a challenge and i am realistic as to what it takes to learn a language that being said while i can tell the people who designed the course have tried their hardest the limitations of the duolingo system were very present throughout the learning process

 theres simply not enough grammar lessons especially at higher levels this can easily be supplemented by using websites like tae kims or googling words or grammatical structures that the course doesnt adequately explain

 no kanji lessons or review luckily i already knew kanji from studying chinese so it was simply a matter of learning slight variants and the new pronunciations other people may need more supplements

 the course as it exists will not teach you how to conjugate well enough to manage a conversation fortunately theres apps that do this i in particular enjoyed japanese conjugation city

 words would not be introduced to you in their base forms and you have to look up the kana used to write words that are introduced in just kanji even worse theres no builtin system to review vocabulary my solution was to keep long lists of words i was learning and then create sporcle quizzes to test myself i had to look up words on websites like jishoorg and wiktionary i only started doing that around about where the initial first course of  lessons ended though although i retroactively created some for verbs and adjectives because i realized i hadnt retained this vocabularly

 practice without the keyboard can be useful but ultimately it gets too frustrating especially at higher levels english is simply so different from japanese that theres too many ways to say everything once you get past the first  lessons or so i find that the grammar gets too complicated and the alternatives dry up too much to be practical the problem with duolingo is that one tiny mistake is enough to mark a lesson wrong even when theres an argument that the meaning was close enough that being said i think ill use it somewhat to supplement speaking lessons which i hope to begin soon

all of my criticisms aside i think that this course really does throw the sink at you in terms of showing you what you need to learn to become an intermediate japanese learner even if it fails to make that material sink in on its own which necessitates looking for supplementary material that being said i still think putting duolingo in the center of language learning at least until you reach intermediate level is the platform that has worked best for me this tree is massive and while i could have gone through this tree faster as i certainly slacked off for a few months in there for many learners  years is not an unreasonable pace it doesnt necessarily give you the tools to learn everything but those tools are readily available online the best thing about duolingo is that it gives you a resource that demands that you create japanese sentences and no other learning tool that ive seen really does that in the same way short of having a reallife japanese speaker to work with

also i have to give a shoutout to language learning with netflix on chrome is invaluable and everybody should get it while terrace house was a very useful thing to learn so is anime dont care what the haters say you can easily look up the words you dont know that are used in anime like kisama and ending a sentence in zo and know not to do that yourself its still very much practical japanese with normal grammatical structure and will help you out a lot but i still think variety is good but the most important thing is that you are enjoying the learning process as that will make you do it more

ironically this is the second time ive finished the japanese tree as previously there was a japanese tree that only covered  units now theres  units so the new course has more than times as much content especially as the first course lacked much kanji the first course felt like a tutorial while this one felt like the real thing i was very glad that the second course got introduced just over a year ago as i was getting bored with the first course when the second one arrived

now that ive finished this course ive still got to review everything ive learned which shouldnt be hard given the vocab lists i created i also screenshot difficult sentences i encountered as i progressed along the course so i can use those in grammar lessons in the future to see where my understanding of grammatical points is lacking i can tell that if i continue to put a few hours in a week i will quickly be able to have japanese conversations although halting at first i havent been speaking much in japanese at all except to myself but honestly that doesnt really worry me i have been avoiding speech deliberately as thats something that comes much easier once youve become familiar with basic vocabulary and grammar already engrained i have the tools to speak now even though this part will take some time if id been enrolled in japanese classes i suppose id have a better environment for elementary conversations but as a selflearner its certainly the case that theres a steeper cliff that being said i am certainly eying italki to see what tutors may be the most useful

so i help that this review of everything ive encountered with the japanese course was useful to some of you please comment below if you have any other questions"

grammar question to vては v 
"how do i speak expressively without throwing off my pitch accent i started using italki a few weeks ago and ive already managed to make really good progress on my previously nonexistent speaking ability

but what i notice when i record myself speaking is when i tried to speak expressively and try to convey my message more with gestures and tone of voice my normally pretty decent pitch accent was thrown off a lot im guessing its to do with the fact english is a lot of the time pitch variations  expressiveness but not meaning

how can i express myself with tone of voice to achieve the same expressiveness that i do when i speak in english

i heard that people pick a parent speaker with a close personality to them and devote many hours to mimicking them to achieve nativelike expression but im guessing this requires a huge amount of work and i dont think im actually good enough to do that yet so is there anything i can do at least in the short time to improve this

id appreciate any advice from someones whos encountered the same problem thank you"

"set a goal to pass the jlpt n what textbook to go to after genki ii hello everyone 
 
last october i set a goal for myself to pass the jlpt n exam by december this year and ever since i have been doing my best selfstudying religiously for at least  hours every day  hours on the weekends  
so far i have enjoyed every single second of it i am so happy when i watch a video on youtube and i understand some parts of what the people are saying

i have just finished chapter  of the first genki book and as it usually takes me about a week to finish a genki chapter i am scheduled to finish genki  in two and a half months if that is the case that leaves me with  months until the exam takes place out of these i have decided to use the last month to revise what i have learned and focus on doing exercises that will prepare me for the exam and  months to focus on acquiring knowledge to pass the jlpt n exam so i would like to ask you two questions

 which bookbooks would you recommend to someone that has finished the genki books and wants to get enough knowledge to pass the n level

   after some research i have found a few posts from a few years ago where some people recommended tobira gateway to advanced japanese and new kanzen master jlpt n reading vocabulary grammar kanji

    are these still the best recommendations
    would you recommend anything else

 for the exam preparation i have found this book 日本語能力試験 jlptn are there any other books you would recommend

thank you in advance for your answers"
"every single japanese learner must have this this is going to be a very basic post inspired by the fact that ive been noticing from some of the questions here that many beginners or even intermediates do not realize how quick and easy japanese lookups can be on a computer

some are pasting basic words here asking about what they mean others lamenting about how difficult it is to read anything because of how many words they have to look up and others while in a much better place are still copying and pasting words into jisho for every look up and hey theres really nothing wrong with the last one if you prefer that but for those who dont i present to you the pop up dictionary one of the most revolutionary tools for japanese learners

 im sure many many in this subreddit already know about them but it appears that a disturbing amount still dont so i decided to share it in hopes that those people recognize that it exists

this is a video of a popup dictionary called rikaichan in use extremely simple just activate it in your browser and it enables you to instantly look up any japanese word you hover over with your mouse extremely helpful while reading pretty much anything in japanese that you find online


here is the download link 

i personally use a different pop up dictionary now called yomichan but its a bit more complicated to get set up and requires illegally downloading dictionary files which some people may not be comfortable with so i figured the safest and easiest to recommend is the one above which has all required files already built in and needs zero setup past the installation 

thats all for all who didnt know about this enjoy  a much less stressful japanese learning experience"

"motivation challenges i have been studying japanese on and off for years i get back into it only to feel like im not really learning are there any study methods or learning programs that dont feel like just useless repetition im not very motivated when it feels like im trying to memorize a dictionary i learn a lot by trying and listening but boredom is a real challenge classrooms are the worst learning environment for me
ive tried japanese for busy people rosetta stone seems expensive but i did do a trial versionand it wasnt too awful duolingo isnt helping at all and i did kinda okay with genki for the first  chapters and then it lost me how long every day should i be studying im burned out and dont want to give up again any advise would be really great

some questions about learning kanji through vocab 
"should i when should i start to focus on learning pitch accent 皆さんこんにちは

so ive been studying japanese for about two months now and i feel like ive made a lot of progress im actually very happy with where i am right now the problem though is that i read a comment on youtube somewhere where a person from japan said that foreigners always get pitch accents wrong thus making the japanese sound really bad this was something that i wasnt aware of so now i am worried that the japanese that i am speaking is actually really bad and sounds ugly but then you look at textbooks im using genki at the moment and it doesnt mention pitch accent at all not even showing the correct pitch accent for each new vocabulary in fact not even dictionaries like jishoorg show you the pitch accent the only dictionary i could find that showed pitch accent is an app called jaccent which is only for ios but it still feels very important since words can have a different meaning with different pitch accents like あめ or はし

so my question is is pitch accent really this important i feel like textbooks would stress it more if it was or is it perhaps something i should worry about later after i get a bit more japanese under my belt or perhaps its one of those things that you just naturally pick up as you listen to japanese and repeat things that people say shadowing how do japanese kids learn pitch accent is that taught in school with every word that they learn or do they just pick it up naturally"

"took a week off regret it ive made a few posts here recently about how im very close to finishing rtk i use this deck which has enggtjap cards and also japgteng cards its designed to encourage learning to write them as well as being able to translate them

so i went on holiday for new years and didnt have the time to sit down and do my daily cards on my computer luckily i have ankimobile so i can still do my cards whenever i have  mins of downtime

anyways me having to do my cards out and about instead of sitting at my desk writing out each character for the enggtjap cards i just had to picture the character in my head obviously when i got a japgteng card i could just recall the english word so no problem not writing down the enggtjap cards for a week really screwed me over ive just sat down for the first time in  days to do my kanji and i really struggled to recall the slightly more complex characters and some of the newer cards

so basically i had  cards to do today and i ended up having to fail about half of the enggtjap cards just because i havent been writing them out all week fun times and wish me luck because later today im heading off on another whole week away so its just gonna worsen my problem and when i get back im gonna have a lot of work to do to get my writing and enggtjap recollection back to where it was"

"the ultimate guide to desu です  study notes and tips to learn japanese fast i have recently been doubling down on the basics of japanese recently i had finished my notes and review on the desu sentence ender i know it may seem basic however once i started to review i quickly realized how slow i was at choosing which one to use while ending my statements

regardless here are my notes for anyone else looking to improve using japanese sentence enders beginning with desu

if you are not into reading here is my video lesson on desu 

 what is desu and how to use it

desu is the japanese sentence ender used to make statements while also adding formality

keep in mind that desu is to be used when ending a statement with a noun do not use desu in a sentence ending with a verb there are other enders you can learn about later used in that case here are some examples of using desu to end a statement

 kore wa inu desu  this is a dog
 boku wa gaikokujin desu  i am a foreigner

 present tense forms of desu

 eg it is i am
 e this is coffee
 r kore wa kōhī desu
 k これはコーヒーです

 additional forms of desu

desu ne ですね

ne ね is used to ask for a casual confirmation such as to say this is good isnt it or this is a good book dont you think so unlike yo よ this does not come across as strong or rude it is light fun and very commonly added when conversing with others

desu yo ですよ

yo よ is a strong way of declaring your statement to be true when added it makes the implication of this is right or dont you know be careful to use this only in a situation where who you are speaking with does not know what you are stating as it may come across as arrogant otherwise

 conclusion

thanks for sticking around till the end of this one i hope these tips have also helped you out understanding how to use desu

so i have been reading some example japanese sentences from the core k anki deck and sometimes the element which they choose to mark as the topic confuses me for example

in this sentence 日曜日 is marked with は which confuses me because i would have said the sentence as

yet for a very similar sentence i went to the pool during summer vacation they write it as

slight grammar difference 
"と at the start of paragraphs 皆さんこんにちはi recently started reading japanese stories for language learners by mcnulty amp sato and was trying to make better sense of the usage of と at the beginning of some of the paragraphs in the story 浦島太郎 urashima tarō

here are some examples note these are only the first sentences in their respective paragraphs 

と呼ぶ声がしました

と亀が言いました

とやさしい声で言いました

now in each of these cases the と sentences were preceded by character quotes so im thinking this construction is related to that for reference the translators explanations do include a section on と when but that appears to be a different と construction than what im investigating

the closest i could find to a satisfactory explanation to my question through google searching was from punipunijapan their grammar lesson on the particle と included a section explaining how this particle can be used to mark quotations here however there was enough difference from the constructions in the urashima story that i wanted to get clarification 

ill include some of whats on the website

gtthe particle と can also be used to mark the end of a thought or a quotation it is often proceeded by the plain form of a verb and followed by verbs like 言う iu  to say 思う omou  to think and 聞く kiku  to listenhear  
gt  
gtexample   
gt  
gt明日は学校に行くと思います  
gt  
gtashita wa gakkō ni iku to omoimasu  
gt  
gti think i will go to school tomorrow

note that in punipunijapans case と is found within the sentence and directly preceding a verb on the other hand in the short story と begins the sentence marked off by a comma

so does anyone have any explanations andor resources that will help me make more sense of this usage

thanks"

im a new japanese learner and i am currently using wanikani and genki to learn but alot of people learning seem to use anki now ik wanikani and anki are both srs but some people have told me it would be better to use anki additionally for vocab but im not sure if thats a good idea and im not sure how to use it for instance when the vocab pops up do i write it down and then check also what should i make the intervals of reviews be

once everything is set up youll be able to automatically generate anki cards from your kindle highlights in around  minutes regardless of the number of cards you are generating for this reason i dont recommend to do this on a daily basis i suggest you repeat this process once every  days or so in order to generate  days worth of cards in around  minutes

for goals im just trying to become conversational for now essentially be able to get around and communicate if i visit japan and hopefully fluent as i progress into more advance curricula like anki

"getting started with italki  what to look for so ive been selflearning japanese for about  months now and am looking into going through the scaryexciting step of actually finding an italki tutor to practice with im feeling a little overwhelmed about not knowing what to look forexpect and would love to hear some perspective or advice  


a rough sketch of my progress so far i know around k of the most common core vocab words and have picked up maybe  or so more niche terms through gamesmusicreading immersion im still working my way through rtk i know its meant to be sprinted through but im really susceptible to burnout and my slow and steady  a day pace has felt sustainable for me but am at around the  mark at this point ive made it through the first hundred or so grammar lessons on japanesepod and have read through the entirety of japanese stories for language learners  a lot of level  tadoku readers and ive developed a solid enough intuitive sense of the grammar from thosealthough i might not be able to verbalize how they work super academically i havent utilized genki or other formalized lesson books because ive always had trouble and anxiety about traditional lessonsassignments and my dopey adhd brain feels wired to reject them i try to do about an hour of passive listening a day minimum and always reread a short story or watch an episode or two of something with japanese subs before bed ive done very little speech practice and find it much more difficult than writing  i have no idea where i would be in terms of jlpt level or what have you but i consider myself a midlevel beginner finally feeling some solid footing  


im a bit worried about signing up for an italki tutor who adheres to a strict lesson plan or starts me at point a i already have a basic understanding of the fundamentals and i dont think my learning style would lend itself to something that formal and structured what im looking for ideally is someone i can attempt to have basic slowpaced conversations with who corrects my mistakes and occasionally introduces some new grammar elementsexpression strategies in an organic way 

i guess im just wondering how to articulateseek out what im really looking for and what others would suggest for someone like me i browse italki and just see an ocean of thousands of strangers faces and get so overwhelmed by how to choose one that will be a good fit i also have a lot of hopefully surmountable social anxiety and am feeling pretty intimidated about meeting up with a virtual strangerif anyone else has dealt with this and can give me some encouragement beyond nut uplike i know or personal experience that would be so great"

just wanted to get some feedback from people ive been studying japanese for the last  or so years one of the things i struggle with the most is my memory and concentration this is not exclusive to language learning ive tried to use anki in the past as a space repetition tool but always struggled with it i found it rather difficult to set up my decks for drills for small decks that i wanted to use for say chapters of genki without having to tell anki a lie and say that i dont know the word so it wont put it a week away then on the polar opposite when using a large deck i find myself getting overwhelmed and im asked the same word about  different times and still struggle to retain the information

ive found that i start using it for a while get frustrated and fall out of it soon after

ive tried using duolingo recently but ive found that its very very slow ive spent the last week constantly going over 中国出身です and the likes ive heard of memrise also but havent looked into it in much detail as i was affairs it would be much the same as duolingo

ive had this tutor for some time now and ive always been slightly intimidated by him but part of it im sure is my own fear of making mistakes which i make plenty of however as time has gone on with him ive found i need to meditate for ten minutes minimum before lessons to stay calm and present during the lesson and i still manage to not and after nearly every lesson i leave feeling disheartened and tbh bad about myself haha hes very quick to correct my mistakes doesnt give me all the support in the world positive reinforcement or encouragement and will let me struggle for minutes with uhms trying to figure out the mistake i made in my sentence when i legit have no clue  that being said many times i do figure out what i did wrong and i dont think hes a bad teacher because i think these methods do actually help me grow in the long run ive just especially lately feel like im about to cry when these are all overeven during the lesson and im worried itll longterm push me away from enjoying learning japanese hes not the most gentle when pointing out my mistakes or telling me i should remember something so basic that ive forgotten but maybe i shouldnt expect to be babied yet again because of this intimidating environment i sometimes make more mistakesspeak more slowly because im second guessing everything

my question to you all is am i too soft or is he just not a nice person should i find a new tutor or stick with him i really cant tell if everyone would more or less be like this also i am really getting pushed to learn more because of him thanks to him my speaking and general japanese have improved a ton yet i also happen to dread every tutor session we have for more context i can be an anxious person and very hard on myself when i make mistakes or doing anything wrong in literally every aspect of life so thats for sure a factor"
"which kana workbook to buy for an absolute beginner hello

so i have a decent background in japanese having taken a few years in high school and college but my wife has  experience with japanese

in anticipation of travel someday opening back up shes started learning japanese we bought _japanese from zero_ book   and are really enjoying the workbookyoutube video combo its interesting for me to see a different angle as well since i learned out of なかま ive found something new in each lesson ___と申します as an actual way to introduce myself どっち for pair identification which i never knew _

anyway enough background  im noticing that if theres one downside to _japanese from zero_ its that the kana isnt introduced up front this is affecting my wifes pronunciation as she reads the romaji and wants to pronounce it as english also how do i say no is it e  e  ay why does it say ai ai ay then i try to explain that its spelled い which she confuses with e and we go back and forth so i was going to buy her the accompanying _hiraganakatakana from zero_ books  but noticed theres also _kana from zero_  i guess my question is is _kana from zero_ just hiragana and katakana from zero appended

"having trouble remembering jj vocab anki cards ive been referring to jj dictionaries when looking up vocabulary for a while now though i still use english and sometimes i have to refer to the simple sanseido dictionary because i still dont get tougher definitions but im comfortable enough that ive been trying to add only the japanese definition of some words to my anki cards when i fully understand the jdefinition 

my issue here is that even when its not a noun i find the definitions can kinda go on for a bit which makes them hard to remember which is the opposite to english where i can just add single words to the cards as the definition and itll be fine and dandy 

so even though i can look at a word and vaguely know the meaning i cant say it to myself or recount it in a way that tells me ah i do remember this because often times i cant remember the japanese definition

i do have sentences with audiotranslations on the back side of the deck which helps and i do admit that i try to recount the jp definition wordforword when i see a card or i feel like ill get lost 

is there something i could be doing better or a way i can think about this better i feel like my brain is stuck on must say full definition or it means you dont know it mode when i use both english and japanese definitions and i definitely feel like i can do something to make me understand or remember jdefinitions but im not sure how

"am i the only one who found it extremely difficult to learn hiragana and katakana everyone says it only takes a week or a few hours if youre committed but this couldnt have been further from the truth for me even with mnemonics i had to study for  hours a day for a week just to learn them all and i was forgetting them very quickly after that it took months of reviewing them and writing them to finally even get close to fluent at reading them 

i just dont understand how it takes some people less time other than the fact that they may not be learning how to write them by memory but that doesnt seem to make sense to me so i dont know how some people learn them so fast 

i will say that the tables have turned for the better lately i am remembering kanji and picking them up very easily memorizing words much easier than it was before but i still cant wrap my head around how some people learned the kana so fast and effortlessly"

"any reason to upgrade to genki  rd edition from second edition i bought genki i nd edition a couple years ago i wasnt too consistent with learning but at my best got up to around chapter  or  i have started learning japanese again and started fresh from chapter one i noticed a rd edition came out in  and i saw that it had some changes such as updating outdated vocab and making the grammar section more comprehensive among other things are any of these changes significant enough to warrant upgrading to the third edition i also have the second edition workbook 

my friend is going to start learning japanese from genki i as well but will be using the rd edition and i was wondering if we will still be able to discuss chapters and concepts pretty easily between editions

thanks and have a nice day"

"video games made into pdf or web pages with pictures script and translation for reading practice hi 

so i make anki decks out of video games mainly jrpgs but i know not everybody here likes anki so i turned my anki decks into something that you can read offline at any time like a book the text is in chronological order so you can use it while playing the game

the file contains hundreds of screenshots and is a bit heavy so heres a screenshot what it looks like

i first made an html version that looks like a table with screenshot japanese and english side by side the pictures are included so you dont need internet to see the pictures as long as theyre in the same folder you can use yomichan or the like to have a dictionary with it as shows in the picture

i changed the layout to make a pdf version because the horizontal layout didnt work that much

i dont know if its going to be useful for anyone but if you like it and would like some changes in the layout like picture size or something like let me know i can do it as long its not too fancy i can maybe work on table of content to have different section like in the game i think like town  town

im just about to start learning japanese ive been excited to learn japanese for months learning a new language is kind of intimidating i just want to make sure i have everything that i need for now my main textbookway of learning is going to be the japanese from zero book series and i will also be using apps on my ipad such as duolingo lingodeer and kanjistudy is this enough for starting out if not please do feel free to leave advice or recommendations
tips and sources for learning japanese for a beginner hi so i thought about learning japanese many times but it wasnt until a few days ago that i really set my mind to it since im just  and have tons of free time i read the guide to learning japanese on the tofugu website and i read that in the beginning you learn the hiaragana of course so i managed to learn it quite well in a hour or  and they said that the next step is of course starting learning katakana alongside the kanji they said its easier to learn the grammar if u know some kanji to begin with so i started my kanji journey  on the wanikani website and probably will use it untill the level  because after that you have to pay for it so the question is are there any good sources for learning kanji that you would recommend to me i already have my eyes on the genki  and  textbooks to learn the grammar later  but i guess that ill get them after i learn some kanji as i said before what do you think about my aproach thx for the answers
i just started and have  idea about where to start hello im thinking about studying abroad in japan once i get to college so i should probably learn the language im reading the beginners guide and such but i still have no idea on where to start i probably have about  to spend on a textbookanything else right about now because i am still saving i am willing to put in the time to study it and learn it it is just i have no idea where to start is there anything you would recommend i do first eg learn the hiragana any youtube videos you recommend i use to study the hiragana any websites in particular

is there an explanation for this so ive just started learning japanese and im learning kanji readings through words most words readings match up with those of the kanji they use but sometimes i see a kanji that has a reading in a specific word that does not match with that kanjis kunyomi or onyomi for example 早 in お早う is read はよ but when i check this kanjis readings both kunyomi and onyomi it has no such reading as that it does have はや which is similar but not はよ so i was asking if there was a nameexplanation for this phenomenon or is it just random

"im tired of looking up obvious words just for their readings but i dont know what else to do it seems like the only thing left between me and truly leisurely japanese reading is that i can never be completely sure that this word whos meaning is obvious from its kanji is pronounced the way i think it might be or some other way entirely given that i can now read both manga and light novels with  comprehension due to lots of mining and vocab grinding up until recently when i quit anki ive reached the fated point where i can confidently guess what new words mean from context andor kanji but as far as their readings it seems like with japanese you can never be sure thus the vast majority of lookups i do now well over  of them are solely to check how the word is read 

i do that because i dont want to find an easy looking word like 大兄 and assume its read おおにい or something only to discover months later ive ingrained a completely incorrect reading that will now take even more effort to correct or 相場 as あいじょう even words like 縁者 where the only issue is whether the second kanji has a 濁音 or not i almost never guess correctly for those i either assume theres one when there isnt or assume there isnt when there is so frustrating i mean there are so many words where both small or large reading mistakes are so easy to make based on the chaotic nature of the kanji reading system 

what do high level japanese readers even do with this phenomenon

do you skip guessing the reading altogether and just go with the meaning you inferred until you hear the word spoken in some audible medium the solution i feel myself heading towards essentially not subvocalizing the word at all until im sure of its reading at some point in the future 

do you have a secret list of japanese words that i guessed the reading of and dont knowcare if im right or not

or do you just have your japanese dictionary perpetually attached to your hip

id love to hear from any experienced japanese readers about this"

"just reached wanikani l any additional sitesservices to create a well rounded study schedule i have been learning japanese for  days today according to my wkstats and i have now reached the pay threshold for wanikani and want to add a bit of structure to my learning before i move forward and ensure my time spent studying is well rounded

i am thinking of this as a checkpoint for me to make sure i am on the right track and using the best resources available and giving them the best share of my free time as possible

ampxb

so far i have tried the following resources and have added my opinionsexperiences with them briefly

 wanikani  i feel this platform is brilliant for helping me learn kanji and basic vocab but i still cannot build any sentences with what i have learned so far and only understand pieces of them when readinglistening this may improve with more kanji and vocab at later levels but feel i may be missing a trick when it comes to grammar speech and sentence building

 kamesame  i have only just heard of this resource so i have linked my wanikani up to it with the api in hopes to fill in the gap

 cure dolly youtube channel  i have only just heard about this and just watched the first lesson of the organic japanese lessons a bit strange with the avatar and voice recording sounding and looking a bit un natural but the content seems very clear simple and makes a lot of sense

 memrise genki  pack  this seems like duolingo done correct and free am i missing something this seems to give me something that is different to wanikani so thought it would be a good addition to my study time

   genki  i have only just bought genki  rd edition and workbook so have yet to make a start on it so cant really comment how i will find it yet the only thing i have heard is it teaches japanese based on english which may not be beneficial

  duolingo  price wise and value wise it doesnt seem to be worth it in my eyes pm for no ads and the ads are very intrusive and annoying and waste a lot of learning time so feel it is unusable without premium

  kanji garden  very nice platform and app to use visually but i just didnt feel the same understanding and level of confidence as i do from using wanikani

  bunpro  i tried it very briefly but was put off it by reviews stating it doesnt show understanding of grammar rather than leave you knowing how to repeat specific sentences so not really worth the time in the long run

ampxb

after using the above for various lengths of time i am thinking i should spend my study time as follows  hour total per day is all i have currently

 memrise   mins learn  new words per day and review for the rest of the time
 genki   mins read and complete workbook
 cure dolly   mins  or  videos per day with exercises
  wanikani amp kamesame    mins reviews when notified  not including in study hour as i can do this throughout the day
 ampxb

is there anything i should strip out with having a small time for studying or is there anything i should fit in to make it a more well rounded approach

is there any easy way to update anki cards created from yomichan so ive been building a mining deck in anki for around a year by using the ankiconnect extension to generate cards from yomichan  since then ive noticed that occasionally when i look up a word in yomichan its definition is poor or doesnt provide enough explanation at which point ill go and look up that word in jisho and usually it will turn out they have a much better definition  i thought that it was because jisho and yomichan were just based off of different dictionaries but no they both use jmdict turns out its just that yomichan comes included with a version of jmdict that is several years old  today i found out that you can manually import that newest version of jmdict into yomichan so now i have the much better definitions but all  cards ive added to my mining deck are based off of the old definitions and it doesnt seem like theres any way to automatically replace the old card data with the new dictionary data  does anyone know of a fix other than manually editing  cards

obviously attempting to learn japanese and using a game for material even though i know it isnt the best way to learn and probably the worst it has sent me down some great paths outside the textbook just wanted to mention that to prevent the inevitable psa but i do appreciate the concern 

with that i just started looking at kanji and have started using wanikani but so far its just teaching me how to spot the radicals and one of them being the first character power what i havent figured out yet is to know which definitionpronunciation of it on jishoorg 

one tells me chikara and the other is ryoku both mean power and ryoku apparently can also mean proficiency since hitting that option turns the options from hiragana to katakana i lean towards it being proficiency

the problem i cant find anything that tells me what the ナ na means in conjunction with if select the option to use katakana the word changes to kana and that makes perfect sense if i am correct that it actually is referring to the syllable definition but makes it even more confusing when comparing to  力ナ

this week im turning  years old on the th and i cant recognise most kanji that i already knew by heart back then due to the lack of exposure most if not all of my online japanese friends vanished  i stopped at jlpt n transitioning to n i had planned to visit and eventually move to japan by the time i reached  to  since way back then i had a solid plan to do so in  i was even looking at ticket costs but then covid happened and that became impossible  
  
the question is should i start again from scratch how can i join a community of local japanese people in japan so i can learn to speak more easily back then there were penpals which i dont think is a thing anymore lol what do you guys recommend for someone in my position or is it just too late for me and i should give up on my dreams of ever visiting and eventually moving to japan

"tips for completing rtk free advice hope it helps discussions interesting

ampxb

brief context

i finished rtk once a few years back that is i reached frame  but without turning all my cards to mature  many were still young and in the midst of learning 

ampxb

for whatever reason soon after that triumph and elation i fell behind on my reviews until many kanji slipped from my shorter term memory  although id reached the end keeping up with reviews was another story 

ampxb

since that first period and quite a few years on i pretty much started over nd time through the whole book and am now at around the  mark 

ampxb

tips

the second time round perhaps with experience behind me i was able to study effectively heres what i think is worth sharing for any who are interested having had much more success the nd time around

 think of maturing your cards get their interval beyond  days like creating strong foundations for a house if you study  kanji its worth letting those mature before moving on too far  by making them really solid the next bunch of kanji are easier to learn why because the primitive elements actual or based on other kanji need to be pretty solid before theyre able to form building blocks for other kanji

ampxb

 studying lesson by lesson rather than everyday ill do  kanji works for me as it adds more interest to the learning as lessons are organised by primitive themes its nice to experience the quirks and character of each lesson  ahh that lesson was easy and what the this lesson has really difficult primitives etc 

ampxb

 learn primitives as seriously as actual frames for me i found it easy to sort of skip over the primitives learning them quickly with a slightly lazy story but this was detrimental good to treat every primitive element as a proper character worthy of a proper story

ampxb

 avoiding burnout seems like the real crux how to do that though i think one can only appreciate the real workload of rtk when a full cycle from new card gt learning gt review has occurred for example if you study  new cards in one day be aware of the demands youve just created for the next day and the next week depending on your schedule settings for me there was this kind of lag effect  i came to see that if i indulge in too many new cards and think look at me go  new cards today then at some point im gonna have to pay for it in reviews and very soon if you were really motivated on monday and so studied loads of new cards to take advantage of that but then come tuesday friday your energy levels are low your busy with other commitments or you just need a break from rtk that happens all the time then you may start to fall behind on your reviews 

ampxb

 finally see reviews as nonnegotiable if you miss reviews your undermining the whole effectiveness of the flashcard review schedule algorithm and its so much more deflating to fail reviews than be more realistic by doing less and be able to pass them all failing cards sucks"
how important is stroke order to learn the basic kanji are there any rules that one can follow to make it easier 
very beginning japanese selfteaching im not really sure what to do from where im currently at ive just learned hiragana and katakana over the past two days and im pretty fluent should i start learning kanji or start learning kana words either way how exactly would i go about doing this myself
what language school is the most intensive as far as the amount of outside learning youll need and the pace as far as i understand all of them have about the same amount of class hours i looked on gogonihongo and theyre saying akamonkai is an intensive school i already study japanese a lot every day so im looking for something that will be similar also from personal experience how intense were your schools

"numbers in names pronunciation and more importantly why so far i have encountered

山本五十六 the  is pronounced as isoroku

五十嵐 is pronounced igarashi not gojyuarashi even the two s in 五十六 and 五十嵐 are pronounced differently

三郎 is pronounced as saburo although 三十日 not a name obviously is pronounced as misoka

一 can be pronounced as ichi or hito which is normal but i have also seen kazu as in 一夫 一男

afaik japanese are free to choose the yomikata of their names but i am sure a normal person would not name his child 山田酒 as yamada champagne so what are the historical reasons that these names come to these readings

and just to throw in what i know and found interesting the reading 東雲 shinonome comes from 篠の目 ancient japs put the 篠 wood on top of their roofs as dormer windows they lay it out in a tictactoe pattern so the sun can shine through those nets look like eyes hence the 目 when morning comes the sun and the clouds from the east becomes visible and finally the reading shinonome"

"how to effectively learn when you dont have a lot of time i started learning japanese january last year and since it was my last year of school i had tons of time up until october until october i learned around k words got through genki   and tobira

but as i said it was my last year of school and i started studying physics in november and let me tell you it was more than hard to even fit in my ankireviews every day now that i got through the startphase and since exams are not in the near future i have a little more time than in the beginning meaning i can comfortably do my ankireviews every day at least

i try to sentencemine  anime episodes every day and do about min of ankireviews 

is that a good way to structure my learning should i do more reviews less sentencemining more mining less reviewing

also i feel like i lose my grasp on grammar slightly things like ように in different contexts are now problematic for me again  in respect to that  should i go over the grammar books again instead of either mining or reviewing for a few weeks or should i just keep doing my stuff and itll eventually return to me

generally all tips for learning with little time are welcome and i apologize for whining about how i feel like i got worse and all that but since i moved from about  hours immersion a day to barely making it to  hour my progress isnt really visible anymore"

"how to avoid overreliance on kanji so ive been selfstudying japanese on and off for many years unfortunately due to my disabilities and various mental issues its very difficult for me to stay on task hence me working for so long i started studying more than a decade ago in high school though ive had years in the interim where i havent studied at all the first thing ive found that is honestly working really well for me is wanikani i knew a fair bit of vocab and grammar coming into wanikani but kanji was absolutely my weak point simple words like 食べ物 or 猫 were totally unreadable to me even though i could hear them and recognize them or read them in kana

now in my wanikani studies im discovering the opposite problem words like 労働者 a word i didnt know before wanikani are easy for me to parse now labor  work  person  laborer roudousha  ろうどうしゃ but if i actually heard 労働者 out loud i wouldnt have a clue i can only parse the meaning by looking at the kanji if i heard the word or read it in kana i have no clue what im looking at

any word i knew prewanikani that im relearning now like 台所 as a random example i feel like ive mastered now i recognize it via kanji kana or spoken hell for a lot of them i can recall them too but im stuck on how to reach that level of recognition for my wanikani vocabulary im working through the anki core k deck as i go and my method there is to remove the kana for cards with words i already know so i can work on the kanji for those im considering going the other way and removing kanji for words ive learned through wanikani so i can focus on practicing knowing the pronuciation is this a good idea or would you recommend something else"

"learning japanese is such a nice hobby ill admit progress has always been slow for me but after a long break ive picked it up again because i realized how nice it was having a hobby that wasnt just video games

not saying video games are bad lol but if its the only thing you ever look forward to its hard to employ moderation

just wanted to share some love for learning japanese as a hobby it can be a bit daunting when you look at a newspaper and cant read  of it but its also really fun and satisfying to learn new things plus the more you learn the closer you are to reading that newspaper

i wont exaggerate learning japanese isnt gonna cure cancer or fix a divorce at least i dont think lmao but i will say that the positive effect that its had on me is giving me something to look forward to that is educational and isnt video games

"where to find small conversation dialogue that one would encounter while traveling so i have tried all sorts of different methods to learn japanese and i always end up losing motivation a big thing that i always see on here is know your why im learning japanese so i can converse with people while im traveling i know you can travel without learning the language but i want to be able to talk with people and ask questions   


i have been using the fluent forever app for maybe a month now and really like the format of introducing new vocab they introduce a whole new sentence to you and then make flashcards for each of the words separately i like the method but got really bored with learning sentences that i will never say   


so i want to get everyones opinion on trying this method of selfteaching focusing on a small conversation that i would probably have on my travels and learning all the vocab in that conversation as well as the grammar points 

also where would be a good resource to find dialog like this actually small conversations that you would want to use in an aiport or a restaurant or a konbini

let me start with my visit to tokyo with my wife

she has been learning some beginner words and questions so that she can be nice to the staff where she buys tea she was telling me about a weird reaction she got and it came from this story

wife walks into store konbanha

staff konbanha

wife genki desu

staff no reply

my wife was puzzled why the staff didnt reply to say they were genki desu and actually didnt reply at all

she forgot the desu ka  at the end unfortunately haha

so i remember thinking fantastic my wife has gone to a store smiling happy said good afternoon and declared im ok

it was a great way for her to remember the desu ka and it definitely brought a smile to my face

for me

its not as great a story but i decided to try pachinko

i put my money in i think sen yen and started turning the nob

lots of balls came so i thought this must be good i had no idea and still dont know how pachinko works

after playing for a while i asked the staff

sumimasen kono  fun de ge mu wo shite demo ima nani wo shimasuka sho to ka nani ka ga arimasuka

the person looked at the machine and i guess i hadnt done so well

i was pointed to a prize area and i was given a can of asahi

moral of this is dont play japanese games if you have no idea what youre doing haha"

"needed help for a kanji learning method i want to try out hey learner fellas

ampxb

a few days back i came across a postan answer specificallyill post in the link if i find it  about a method there was a comment which caught my attention

basically what the commenter suggested was you do around  kanji worth of stuff initially through srs   and then start immersing in content gradually through media and stuff and that should be your main source of infolike when you have a context its easier to remember ig that sums up the main point of answer that i understood

ampxb

now i thought about implementing this method and this is what i came up with

 ill do around  kanji and its related main vocabfrom kanji learners course and set it up in anki every day

 about grammar what i thought was to pick up genki i and start it side by side with kklc and give around  days to a particular lessonalso including the importantused vocabulary in that chapter

ampxb

so around  kanji a day or  a month so  in  months

 days a lesson so would finish around  lessons in  monthplus all those extra vocab that i picked up

ampxb

i have not thought what exactly i would do once i m done with this  month of task your guidance is much appreciated

ampxb

and also the main question that i want to ask through this post is about the plans feasiblity

to all those who have passed this stage will it go as i am thinking or are some changes recommendednecessary

there are obviously a lot of puzzles and other activities for children on the site but ive found the practice sheets very helpful to practice writing and learn a lot of vocabulary from context 

personally im using printed books used in elementary school in japan but these materials are very similar 

hiragana 



katakana 



elementary school



first level of kanji that has both practice and tests 



first year vocabulary practice

"found a great channel for beginner n listening comprehension  benjiro  beginner japanese  

theres two dozen or so videos and the topics are roughly the same for each but since its with a different person you will generally test out new voucab in each one the pace is fairly slow so if you know a word you certainly wont miss it and the host benjiro speaks in a way thats pretty similar to how i would formulate a sentence myself and probably how most other beginners would as well"
japanese internet slang 
need advice on how to start learning japanese i appreciate the resources that are posted on this community but as a non native english speaker where should i start ive heard that instead of tackling all the aspects of kanji i should know most of their meanings first the thing is that i dont even know hiragana or katakana im open to any advice thanks in advance
will i be ready for the jlpt if i get through genki  remembering the kanji and a few other books theres an exchange program ive been planning to enroll into for  years now ive reached the gpa requirements all the other requirements but the one that worries me is the  years of japanese study it doesnt need to be formal you just need proof that youve been studying that long i have abunch of note books full of notes you also need to pass a proficiency test i started strictly studying japanese december of  i dabbled in it a few months before by the time of the program i will have almost  years of study minus  or  months these months were the ones i was dabbling in japanese so i dont know if these would count i think theyd let me participate if i were to pass their test would genki and the other resources of japanese books help me get to this point by august this year i memorize things farely quickly if that helps and im doing good with grammar

im curious to see if anyone has done this i have decided to learn ten kanji a day all from the joyo kanji which means i will be learning  plus kanji in  months do you think this is possible and would i be able to read japanese once im finished
is lingodeer or genki better sorry if its the wrong flair asking as a person who has just started japanese i did duolingo for a couple of days then i heard some really bad stuff about it which made me think i probably shouldnt be using it i also heard of japanesepod which is what my friend uses but now im hearing that its good to use on the side from what ive read its either lingodeer or genki and i hear a lot of mixed reviews for the two so im wondering what everyones opinions are and what would be best for a beginner
"doubt about colors i have already searched about this but i could not find any definitive answer well how do i know if i can use an 色 after a color because i have already heard a lot of people that say the color red as 赤 instead of 赤色 yet i rarely hear someone saying just 紺 instead of 紺色 can someone give me a pattern and if there is no pattern the exceptions listed or something useful like that

some of them are used with the 色  of the time because without this kanji indicating that it is a color the word would have another meaning like 空色 without the 色 it means just sky does it have something to be with the question above and about the 紺色 part even when i search on google just the 紺 part it appears as navy blue already

and i would also appreciate if someone told me when i can use the colors with 色 and without 色 or if both options have the same use


sorry if it is a dumb question"
"how do you guys feel about kanjidamage hey all 

started my japanese journey around a week ago originally with japanese from zero though im soon gonna give genki a try as well i already know the kana quite well so ive decided to start learning a bit of kanji out of all the resources i saw out there kanjidamage seemed the most thorough and i do enjoy the more immature side of it what are general opinions on it if i could id have done wanikani but im flat broke

another question i downloaded the official kanjidamage deck for anki the cards however were duplicate one with frontback and the other backfront so to say read or write is there any way for me to filter them so i can do just the read cards i tried searching online but no dice"
"what level should my japanese be if i were to become an psychiatrist in japan so im thinking about what i should do career wise when i finish school im thinking about being a psychiatrist because im good at talking good a comforting people and im quite friendly or an accountant because im good at math good with handling money and i dont mind offices 

when i finish id like to go to akamonkai language school as i heard its the best for people wanting to get in a japanese university because they have special classes for preparing students for the eju youd need to go for a  year course to prefect your japanese 

and i have seen that many japanese people mainly kids and young adults have horrible mental health and that depression and suicide is on the rise over there

and apparently they have a shortage of psychiatrists so i thought that i could become that because they would help people for the greater good 

what level should my japanese be to accomplish this and would i have to learn business japanese"

"reentering the learning game at a higher level i should preface this post by saying that i joined this subreddit initially in  and since then have graduated from high school studied japanese the whole way completed a school exchange in osaka undertook a working holiday and recently returned to japanese study and finished off a bachelor of arts majoring in japanese

i am about to begin education studies and one of my teaching areas will be japanese although i have been studying japanese for a long time i have definitely been on again off again for the last  years or so i am very very keen to get back into japanese study and actually work towards a level of proficiency where i can have more than a basic conversation with some fairly gaping holes in my grammar and vocab i think this is essential to being able to teach japanese at a high school level and for my own personal goals

my question is whether there is any kind of way to gauge where i currently am on the spectrum of japanese proficiency beyond the jlpt or if that is the only method that i could use i have already gotten back into study and am working my way through but it can be tedious when there is so much that i already know mixed in with things that i need to work on for the record i have checked the wiki and searched for posts on this topic but wasnt sure that i found anything that answered my question

tldr i have a solid level of japanese and over a decade learning experience want to know if there is something tailored to someone reentering consistent learning at a more experienced level"

"language school in tokyo for advanced learner  recommendations hello im hoping to go to japan and attend a language school for one year i have seen lots of posts with recommendations for beginners but my situation is a bit different

im looking for an intense course that can help me reach actual fluency my comprehension is fairly high but i would love to really get to practice speaking and writing at the level of complex discussions about abstract subjects etc i like studying so a fastpaced and demanding course would be the best learning business japanese is not a priority does anyone know of any schools that run courses like this it would have to be in tokyo or near tokyo preferably on the nneibaraki side the n jlpt is not my ultimate goal but i do wish to take it i passed the n in  was gonna try the n in  but a pandemic broke out 

what im hoping to get out of the course is getting to use japanese in situations that are hard to do on my own in my everyday life ie write essays classrom discussions and debates presentations

"im not sure how to approach kanji hi fellow learners 
just a confused beginner in japanese here i know kana some grammar and i can recognize about  kanji but i dont know the readings well i mostly picked them up with vocab so i know the kanji and the reading in the vocab but not the other readings mostly i would like to learn more kanji but i am not sure how
  so my question is how do you learn kanji  do you study to meaning and readings all at once or do you learn to recognize the kanji first and then go back and learn the readings later or do you study kanji in vocabulary or maybe you learn by radicals
also do you use flashcards for kanji or write them down i think i would like to use quizlet for my kanji but i am not sure how to structure the flashcards itself 
also do you go by jōyō kanji or any other frequency lists or do you just study whatever kanji you feel like 
basically i would just like to read your input on learning kanji because i read too much about this topic and i probably just confused myself on how to go about it 

hope i made sense "
"advice for using wanikani for production and reading im level  on wanikani i like the system a lot and its the longest ive stuck with any learning tool by far
my reading has improved tremendously in the past  or so months where im able to comfortably read yotsuba comics and get through most nhk easy new articles

but wani kani does little for vocab recollection if i want to use a word in speech i have to force myself to remember the two or more kanji that make it up and most of the time i have trouble

my question is is there a sidebyside tool out there for memorizing vocab along with ones wankikani level im imagining a flashcard system that shows you the english definition and you have to recall the japanese pronunciation 
it seems like waste to have all this onewayonly vocab in my brain"

"most embarrassing mistake of my life this moment has haunted me for a while i figured a good way to cope would be to tell everybody on the internet about what an idiot i am 

so im taking a japanese class in school its a pretty easy one but for me its just fun to sit and talk to the teacher and learn stuff it has definitely improved my speaking even though its not the most fitting course

either way i was talking with the teacher one day and i noticed that she was wearing some very colorful clothes she doesnt usually wear stuff like that so i though to compliment it now i didnt actually know the word colorful but i had somewhat recently learned っぽい my thought process was then that if childish is 子供っぽいand forgetful is 忘れっぽい then colorful is obviously 色っぽい safe to say that was not the correct word it went something like this teachers name先生は本当に色っぽい服を着ていますね 
its safe to say that i didnt get the reaction i expected

tldr accidentally said my teacher was wearing really sexy clothes

new to the language learning thing aside from being a monolinguist obviously ive done some research  looked at various posts on this subreddit and ive come to the conclusion that i should start with kana then move to kanji i see all these posts about just got down my th kanji go me or i learn  kanji a day but i would rather start of slow instead of shoving thousands of kanji in my head and i would rather learn kana   kanji and actually learn how to put them into coherent and proper grammatical sentences for my first year of learning but ofc this is just a rough outline and anything goes as i move along and then once i have that down i can use that knowledge to help me understand the next  or so kanji so what im wonder is if this is a solid plan or if im heavily overestimatingunderestimating the rate that a person can learn kanji because to me  sounds daunting plus the kana and im uncertain if i can do it but then yr also sounds like a very long time so im uncertain if im underestimating my ability to understand and learn but i guess this is a subjective thing and depends on the person i guess im trying to ask how did your first mnthyr of learning go and how much did you actually learn because i may be able to get a better understanding of what realistic expectations can be and align my goals that way

i can have conversations fine in japanese although not very fluent and can read stuff fine

"having a hard time parsing sentence in tobira my upcoming semester at my university is in a few weeks so ive been preparing for my japanese class by looking through and reading the 読み物 sections of tobira to get an idea how the book works however ive noticed when it comes to long compound sentences ive been having trouble parsing the exact meaning i finished the genki  and  textbooks alongside the irodori books however none of those books covered extensive particle and sentence mixing like this before 

for example on pg  chapter  when describing locations in japan it states

gt日本には昔からの名所もたくさんあります例えば兵庫県にある姫路城は日本で最も美しいと言われているお城で年にユネスコの世界遺産に選べれました

i understand almost all of the vocab since ive been anki reviewing them before reading but putting the idea together as a cohesive sentence is proving to be hard here is my interpretation of the two sentences without being grammatically perfect kind of direct translation for each part so i can break it down

the first sentence isnt bad since im used to seeing short sentences in textbooks online and etc

gt日本には昔からの名所もたくさんあります  
gt  
gtin japan along time ago there are a lot of famous places

ive seen には before and from what i can recall it means its talking about places existing at the topic 

gt例えば兵庫県にある姫路城は日本で最も美しいと言われているお城で年にユネスコの世界遺産に選べれました  
gt  
gtfor example in hyogo prefecture exists the himeji castle は now the subject in japan it is said that there are a lot of beautiful castles で talking about doing things in at the castle or japan in  unescos world heritige に chose the castles

at first i thought the topic was strictly about the hyogo prefecture where the castle exists but then the sentence keeps going and the topic then seems to expand on the idea of more places also being famous then it mentions 日本 and 最も美しいお城 more beautiful castles i think that it means were still talking about the region and other places but the particles are throwing me off especially the usage of はにで particles from my limited knowledge of them は is the topic に is talking about going to a place or talking about the place itself and で is doing an action within a place

any help even small grammar usagedefinitions correction are appreciated i tried looking up more examples online but its hard to pinpoint exact particle usages on specific sentences on google i can throw the sentence into google translate if im so confused but i usually only do that as a very last resort after breaking down the sentence"

my question is if its worth it to continue japanese classes through my college next year college classes are obviously expensive so im wondering if it would be a better idea to either self study or take private lessons i enjoy the college classes a lot because i find that having my assignments graded by someone else and having a strict course schedule helps a ton with motivation i  want to continue learning the language and eventually become fluent 

any insight is greatly appreciated"

"ive decided that im japanese mindset shift heres a mindset shift ive made that may be useful to some of you

i moved to japan  weeks ago and plan to be here for a few years a big part of this decision was my love for japanese learning which ive worked at daily for the past  years

my level is low conversational ie i can pretty much get any point across if im  with someone who is patient and similarly for listening comprehension 

when i arrived here i was throwing myself into interactions asking people at the supermarket about this and that and everyone was and still is incredibly friendly

unfortunately ive been shocked to find that my confidence has plummeted over the past few weeks to the point where i avoid interactions and conversations being ok with only understanding  of some japanese show on netflix is one thing but being unable to ever truly understand and be understood by the people im around gets pretty disheartening 

something has to change or im just going to go further into my shell and squander this opportunity to immerse myself in japanese language and culture so heres the shift

im telling myself that im japanese yes that sounds stupid and im aware that im not japanese and never will be

however im employing the fake it until you make it mindset which ive had great success with in other areas of life and so im going to go into every interaction assuming that ill be understood and will be able to understand the other person the point of this is that it will get me in the interaction in the first place and showing up with confidence will mean im even more open to attempting to communicate in a meaningful way with the people around me

i hope this will help at least one of you in some way in any case all the best with your japaneselearning journey"

"learning to read japanese only to understand books hi everyone

there are a few japanese books that i really want to read but they havent been translated and i doubt they ever will be so i have decided to learn how to read japanese in order to be able to understand these books to give you an idea one of them is written by a journalist and records his interviews with the survivors of the great east japan earthquake of 

i dont intend to learn how to speak listen or even pronounce japanese i am only looking for the most efficient way to read and understand these books by myself using a dictionary for the relatively rare words that i wouldnt understand

so i have started to learn the meaning of words from the anki core kk deck with  new words per day in order to finish it in one year i only study the translation of each of these words and i also look at the translation of the example sentence not their pronunciation once i finish or at least learn the first k i plan to read japanese news and learn grammar on the go using a dictionary and a grammar guide

if i go down this path will i be missing essential ingredients to reach my goal or will it be enough

thank you very much for your help "
"i can read manga after  hours of study my study hours

when i started reading manga in english my language skills dramatically improved so reading manga in japanese had been my number one goal even before i actually started studying the language it was at that time that i asked a friend how much it took him  he told me he could read them after a year i was disheartened he even studied japanese at university and i was thinking of doing everything by myself i decided to try my best anyway and to note down my study time as well it turns out after about  hours of selfstudy give and take i can read manga in a way that to me is well enough i decided to write this post to reassure beginners even though i am a beginner myself and to give some fairly reliable statistics to the question after how much study is it possible to read manga in japanese of course the answer will be different depending on the circumstances but i definitely am not a genius and if i could do it so can you 

i think its important to define what reading manga means in this context after about  hours of study i can very slowly read manga in japanese i look up most words on the dictionary and some grammar point on the internet however after this i can understand almost everything in the end my comprehension of the story is similar to the one id get if i read in my native language or in english this is why even though im not fast i dont feel any frustration and reading is a very positive experience for me 

there are some things i havent counted in those  hours the most useful one is that ive been watching anime in japanese with english subtitles for  years in those years ive never focused on understanding the language but i somehow still got a lot of things passively the second important thing is that i know romance languages grammar very well as i studied it for  years at school then there are things i dont consider important for example i didnt count when i tried studying with tae kim i dont know how many hours i put in but i read at least half of it i was feeling very confused and i repeatedly failed reading manga at that time when i restarted i did it from zero i also didnt count studying  jouyou kanji i did this two years ago without any grammar whatsoever and i forgot most of them i dont think any of that time spent on kanji helped me in reading manga apart from the first  hours spent on understanding what kanji are and how radicals work 

i dont think theres any trick to reading manga early apart from studying using good material for me that was organic japanese with cure dolly i followed her lectures and then i could understand manga thats about it i think shes a great teacher and you should check her out this was the video that won me over however keep in mind that everyone is different she answered my specific student needs precise logical grammar explanations and a positive attitude towards studying if you have different needs youll probably end up benefitting from different study material 

i wrote this because i remember when studying japanese wasnt happy for me at first i was so scared about not being able to learn the language that i was too anxious to actually try i couldnt even think about it then i fought against that but ended up with my fear becoming real even if i studied i couldnt understand anything i was so frustrated and confused and i used to think japanese didnt make sense that it was an absurd language with this post i just want to spread the message that if you keep a positive attitude put in effort and study from good teachers be it in uni or by yourself you will make it have faith in yourself and in your skills"
"am i taking the wrong approach to kanji tldr at bottom so i am using an anki deck that closely mimics wanikani to the point where is no difference apart from the fact that you could say my deck is better because it has all of the functionality of anki so are far as your concerned lets just say i am using wanikani

the thing is what ive been doing is memorising everything  radicals kanji vocab and all but when i am memorising the radicals i memorise the general shape and make nothing special of it so then when i memorise the kanji i kind of just see it for as it looks because im not really using the mnemonics either

this isnt working terribly as i am remembering everything quite well but do you think i should be fully focused on getting the radicals and the configuration of the radicals in each kanji into memory

another thing this is just speculation but it seems like radicals kind of have readings or rather in some cases the kanji takes the reading of the radical on the right if that radical were to be treated as a kanji are there any free or paid resources for learning things like this

im around nn level and i fear that i really should have more kanji knowledge by now

ampxb

tldr is it okay to not fully concentrate on learning the radicals that make up each kanji and not use mnemonics formed from the radicals to remember the kanji"

i wanted to know if there are any undergraduate degrees i could do online while i still work my job i intend to apply for jet in  i want to visit japan in  if the pandemic is over i live in north carolina but i cannot find anything in my own state that offers online degrees for japanese perhaps i am also looking in the wrong places

that year has passed and ive since made the effort to find a teacher finished genki i and shokyu nihongo  right now im in the middle of genki ii and beginning to revise from shokyu nihongo  i have made a progress definitely not a major one but one that im still proud of when i lacked motivation or were telling myself that i can learn tommorow i remembered that answer and sat down   with the books

ive been studying japanese for  years now in my first year i did the stuff everyone does genki tae kim rtk wanikani still doing wanikani rn i recently reset so i could redo some kanji

ampxb

whenever i listen to something or read something i just cannot for the love of god understand and parse whats being said with listening another problem arises i cannot pick out the words being said for example i listen to a conversation understand nothing because i didnt pick up anything turn on japanese subtitles and immediately recognize the words but then the previously mentioned problem arises of not being able to parse and understand the sentence even though i have knowledge of the grammar being used and even the vocab

its kinda like reading the following sentence in english basic example i am going to the bathroom having knowledge of all the vocab and grammar but not being able to put everything together for it to make sense in your head

ampxb

i find myself trying to translate to english when readinglistening more often than actually understanding my native language is not english its dutch and whenever i read or listen something in english it just makes sense and i dont do any translating to my native language in my head

ampxb

its hard for me to explain whats really going on but i hope this can somewhat give you an idea about my situation

ampxb

overall my kanji is decent and can always improve and i dont think its the limiting factor since its more straight forward and less ambiguous

if any of you have been in a similar situation and could give me some advice as to how to continue thatd be great im super demotivated and scared that my  years of study were all for nothing and that its all useless knowledge"
"so i want to learn japanese but dont really care about the writing aspect should i still follow the same steps as the starter guide basically title im going to japan next year or whenever covid ends for few months and want to know how to speak conversationally i dont really care about the writing portion as long as i can read enough to know what signs are saying ill be fine i think 

so i know most of the problems with japanese learning stems from the difficult writing system so is there some sort of study plan where i can just forgo that and focus on the speakinglistening portion of the language

are 書く and 描く synonyms from what i know 書く means to write and 描く means to draw recently i was listening to a song and the lyrics goes あの夏に見た花火を書いた i guess saying that i wrote the fireworks i saw that summer doesnt make much sense which made me conclude that in this context 書いた should mean to draw the question is whether these two verbs are always interchangeable or if there are situations in which one if preferable over the other

yet separate the word into three parts and it becomes futari wa purikyua  how does the ha turn into wa i thought that は was ha and wa was わ

am i the only one struggling with listening comprehension i dont know why since i dont normally have a hard time with that in other languages but with japanese i am super bad seriously i listen to audios like three times until i really understand each word am i the only one does somebody have any tips or nice sources for practicing it im not a beginner a little farther than beginner but definitely not intermediate sometimes i feel like i will never understand this language and it frustrates me since i speak several languages but japanese is a real challenge for me  have a great week everybody 
"the results of learning japanese ive been learning japanese for something like  years now and i must say it feels so amazing to make obscure connections between things i learn and things i have experienced with the language

for instance just a few moments ago i learned words for demon and so forth one of my favorites is 閻魔大王 like demon king or something anyway there are other words for this kind of entity including 悪魔あくま 魔神まじん 閻魔えんま and the kicker 天魔てんま

a long time ago i watched an anime called monster and the main characters name is kenzou tenma 天馬賢三 its written differently but its clearly on purpose 天馬天魔 monster haha funny

furthermore ive finished the phoenix wright trilogy not that long ago in english ive watched some of the anime in japanese because playing it in japanese was too hard and oh my god it makes me want to spend another  hours playing the game in japanese the names are in my opinion funnier than the english names phoenix wright is naruhodo ryuichi なるほど of course and larry butz is yahari masashi yahariやはりやっぱり i knew it haha funny

it made me realize that theres an entire world of humor we cant experience or appreciate unless we learn the language whats more its funny because its so different but the humor is made in the same ways plays on words puns weird metaphors that only flow well in the foreign language jokes hidden within names the fact that violetta pwtat gives phoenix a casebreaking hint in the form of a threat to one of the characters phoenix is pursuing at least in the anime that also happens to be a wordplay with her name urami shikabane 虎様恨みuramiますor watch your back don tigre but she means 裏見uramiます which means look at the back of the note i gave you

i hope my experiences with japanese humor helped inspire you to stay motivated to learn this amazing language it sure helped me"

"what is too old to start learning japanese should i try again i know i know people say you can learn anytime true you can at  i could start after all

however at  i started studying jp i did it as a self study home project as a hobby it took me some time but i mastered sentence structure some vocabulary  kana basic grammar and some other bits mostly entry stuff but i felt i was making steady progress for a self study style student life at some point which  i cant remember why i stopped studying maybe life got busy now whilst i still retain some of my past knowledge because i was a big anime fan a bit of vocabulary stuck in my head i decided i wanted to learn again the problem is i am almost  now  years  on from my small start i made and realistically have forgotten a lot of what i learned i remember having fun learning  as i progressed it was super rewarding to learn new grammar and say a sentence which made sense yet now i am struggling to motivate myself to start again i want to but part of me refuses to pick up the books and start again

i had a lot of free time back then so  hours a day was nothing much as i only worked part time but now i work  office job normally not getting home until gone pm  i think this is the barrier i am struggling to cross by the time i get home and get dressed drink ect its closer to pm trying to tell myself to study for  hours or so before maybe catching a quick drama before sleep isnt easy 

thus my question when is too old in life so this reason how to make the time i dont want to be the student who only puts  hour in and learns little i want at least  hours a week a break day once is fine studying i want to visit japan before i am old and dont wanna be another foreigner gaijin sure i was brought here by anime but i became hooked through said source on jp culture to the point i sometimes spend my breaks at work looking where i want to visit what shrines mountains walks cities ect

so is  too old to make this happen am i just making excuses should i return to the learning world again i hope my previous knowledge will return i can still see kana and remember most of them which is a start i guess"

by way of reference i am also learning chinese using the official hsk textbooks and a really helpful resource for me has been chinese zero to hero which provides hundreds of video lessons explaining every bit of grammar in the exact order of the textbooks i was wondering whether there was anything similar for tobira 

as a last resort i could hire an italki teacher to ask questions but was wondering whether there were any more systematic courses i could look at before doing so"

pronunciation of sentences i feel like the way i speak sentences is very unnatural i dont know what tone of voice i should use for which part of sentences if that makes sense and how much i should enunciate those parts i dont think im explaining this well but i feel like i just sound incredibly unnatural when i speak full sentences and i dont know how to learn how to speak better

"flashcards homemade vs digital im torn about whether i should use digital flashcards or make them on note cards

i do like the idea of brainscape using the timed recall thing but then i havent implemented it yet so im not sure of its efficacy

tips on merging completed core  with new core  or core  decks im finishing the core  anki decks soon and ive been wondering if theres any way where i can continue learning with the core  or  without having to relearn all the basic words so ideally i would be able to somehow merge the decks where the cards that refer to the same words get deleted in the new deck only problem is these cards wont be identical so not sure if it can be automated would it be safe to simply delete the first  words or so or is the order in the decks different in your experience
"does anyone paradoxically find that kanji are easier to read than just kana sometimes i play old video games where due to hardware limitations they couldnt cram a bunch of complex kanji into the game roms so they just used kana and spaces

but i find this makes the game somewhat harder to read as a nonnative speaker as many words are homonyms and i have to find out which one they mean kanji removes that ambiguity altogether

a particulars egregious example of this is star fox on the snes where only a few things are in kanji and the rest is all in katakana yuck"

in a nutshell how would a japanese speaker convey the following using the suru verb study

i am studying

i will be studying

i was studying

i studied

i have been studying

i will have been studying

i had been studying

i had studied

hard mode i will have had studied rare even in english but technically valid

if its not too much trouble id also be interested in the same thing with a godan verb like to eat or an ichidan verb like to see

hello

hope everyone is doing well it has been a year since i started learning this language and i have grown in love with the process so much that i decided to share my experience with other learners i have listed the resources that i have found helpful there are countless resources available in this subreddit so i made this post in hopes of organizing some of this information

i would like to thank usuikacider for writing a year to learn japanese before reading that post i had no intention of learning a language much less japanese it was well written and motivated me to begin my journey

 kana

i am sure everyone knows the kana already but this is for those who still have not started learning yet i used japanesepods videos on hiragana and katakana both videos use mnemonics to memorize the characters i then practiced recognizing using this drill spend a couple of hours spread out over a week in order to get familiar get comfortable with recognizing the characters as they are necessary in order to move forward

 grammar

immersing in japanese with native materials is an essential part of learning the language but i believe that everyone needs a foundation of the basics before doing so genki serves to accomplish that i went through genki  and  to learn beginner japanese grammar although i like its approach i do agree that it is not a perfect resource and has its flaws some of the grammar explanations can get confusing and one could argue that textbook grammar is not the same as colloquial grammar the books are also quite expensive but it will serve useful in the long run nevertheless it does its job of introducing you to the language well if you stay committed

there are a lot of supplementary genki resources available so that your learning path is smooth this link is a grammar index where you can find every grammar point available on genki this link is the genki notes of udrugkeeper both are quite good to review genki grammar from time to time you can practice genki materials through here thanks to uselentoanuri if you learn well through videos i would recommend you to check out tokini andy he explains genki grammar really well and often discusses about how the grammar would be used in a real life conversational scenario this is a series of videos covering genki grammar by a professor i would also look through the genki video collection they are short and funny videos that cover genki grammar content lastly going through the genki workbook would be a good idea yes it is easier to just move on to the next chapter without working on the exercises but it is there for a reason spending the time to practice them would help you remember the content well

ampxb

tae kims grammar guide is also a popular resource that i use to review sometimes plus it is online and free other online grammar resources include imabi and wasabi however they are grammar references and not grammar guides so use them accordingly the dictionary of japanese grammar is a favorite in the subreddit although i have yet to try it i am currently learning intermediate japanese through tobira it is an amazing textbook as it covers a lot of topics on a deep level and prepares you well to tackle native resources naturally there is a noticeable difficulty gap between tobira and genki but i am told it gets easier as i progress through the textbook i really enjoy the textbook path and owning physical books motivates me to learn more so i intend to continue after tobira by going through authentic japanese progressing from intermediate to advanced assuming i am interested in  textbooks then my next step would be rapid reading japanese it goes without saying that my primary focus of learning japanese is using it to consume native media through books movies anime and connecting with other people however i do like textbooks as a secondary resource to support me along the way it is totally fine for others to switch learning methods depending on their preferences we all have our unique learning paths and we shall follow them as such

 kanji

my favorite part of learning japanese by far anyone can blame how learning numerous kanji is a tedious process but if you take a moment to appreciate them the learning gets a lot more fun kanji make reading japanese so much easier each kanji carries its own story and it helps you find the meaning of a word although writing is probably the least important skill today i found writing out the kanji helps me remember the meaning well you also notice that stroke order follows a pattern after writing kanji a while i started with a pencil but i now have a fude brush pen which is really fun to use

ampxb

there are a variety of resources to learn kanji from it is up to the learner to see which ones suit their style and which ones do not reading through this post  by ussjevot helped me find my method it is a review of kanji materials by a someone who studied for the jlpt n i would say the three most prominent kanji materials would be kklc wanikani and rtk i tried rtk but an issue with it is that you have to learn  kanji without knowing any vocab it misses the most important part of learning  context wanikani was a good resource but i did not like they way it taught the kanji readings so i dropped after  levels if you do learn through wanikani check out this this wanikani guide by a guy who finished it in a year kklc was the best resource i found that suit my needs it groups similar kanji together so you learn to think about their differences from the getgo all vocab covered use kanji that you have previously learned learning the vocab helps understand the usage of the kanji and exposes you to the various readings of the character it is a lot more efficient to learn the readings through the  vocab trying to memorize kanji readings without context would be the fastest way to give someone a headache i would like to mention another resource it is for learners who know already know several hundred kanji it is called the  kanji odyssey and is a fantastic way to review i highly recommend any intermediate learners to check it out as it contains vocab as well as sentences with audio i also wish to try kanji in context sometime in the future the courses only drawback is that the it uses some kanji in vocab that is only covered later on making it unsuitable for beginners i encourage everyone to try the different resources and see for yourselves which ones suit your needs best

 anki

without a doubt the best tool to review information remembering vocab is so much easier with anki looking through the anki manual helps to get used to the layout i used this anki deck for reviewing vocab from genki it does have some odd specific words from the supplementary vocab list but you can remove those cards the kklc anki deck is well made and goes along with the kklc book another deck i use is the  kanji odyssey making your own decks is preferred and helps you remember better but it is timeconsuming i use an anki deck where i add vocab i run into often that is not covered in my books

the core decks and the jlpt tango series are also viable ways to learn vocab although i have only used them for a brief while memrise is a substitute to anki but there is a lot of freedom for customization with anki

progressing in listening is straightforward but difficult the only way to improve your listening skills is to listen listen and listen some more you will have to dive in and keep consuming content to move forward listening material varies greatly between people depending on their interests and preferences but here are a list of podcasts to get started i would also recommend japanese with noriko ひいきびいき さくら通信 and 人生という宝物 check out benjiros youtube channel for conversational japanese my youtube favorites would be スーツ 旅行 and 華丸大吉のなんしようと

ampxb

there are countless listening material available explore on your own to find which ones interest you it will be hard when you cannot keep up with the dialogue or have no clue with what is being said but you will improve over time as you persevere the mass immersion approach has a huge list of tools you can use for listening watching slice of life anime is an easy way to get started netflix also has a large catalogue of shows to watch you can pick up a lot of phrases through a show like terrace house for example

ampxb

i enjoyed watching ヤンさんと日本の人々 it is a story about ヤンさんs journey across japan it is intended as listening practice for learners it was made over  years ago so the video quality may not be as good but it provides a very good view into japanese life and culture some similar material i found are つながるひろがるにほんごでのくらし and erins challenge

 reading

the process behind reading is essentially the same as listening you will need to get lots of exposure in order to get better at it keep continuing and you will make progress ukymus wrote an amazing guide that covers every detail and resource about reading in japanese i highly recommend you check it out if you are ever interested in learning to read japanese the only resource that i can think of not covered in that guide is satori reader also here is a technical guide to reading for intermediate learners

 conclusion

i really hope you find this post helpful as a reference i like browsing through this sub and finding resources that interests me so i figured i should compile all of this information in a post to share with others i was going through a rough period of life from stressful academics during distance learning and family emergencies from covid  but learning japanese in my free time was the one thing that i  always looked forward to i learned so much about myself and about japan through this experience i am glad to have found this community with caring people who support each other in the passion for learning japanese thank you so much and i wish you the best in your studies"
besta good vocab anki deck 
"where did you go after tobira selfteaching hello everyone 

basically ive reached a sort of plateau in my studies and im not sure where to go next for context i did 

 genki 
 genki  work book
 half the genki  work book
 tobira
 shinkanzen master series n
 level  wk
 nearly maxed out the n track on bunpro nn fully completed

and i took the n test in december and im hoping for a good result anyway im not entirely sure where to take my japanese journey next ideally id like to take the n at some point i use the exams as progress markers basically but im not sure how to get there 

im currently reading some manga and novels with the help of some translation here and there im also playing through muv luv in japanese for a bit of fun i watch some shows and anime in japanese so ive probably got a decent spread of naturally trying to pick up on some stuff but i dont feel like im done with textbooks ive still got the tobira workbook to get through which would be good for review but my main question is in the title where do you go after tobira"
what anki deck should i use currently i only have basic understanding of japanese 
is there a way to use copy subs from in vlc player i was wondering if there was a way to use yomichan on vlc or a way to quickly copy the subs that appear much like learning lnaguage on netflix
genki textbook 
genki textbooks 
learning japanese words what tool should i use ive tried to use duolingo to learn japanese words but then after checkpoint two it begins to introduce kanji which i dont want to learn until i finish learning the words grammar particles etc would there be any books apps or anything similar that could help me with learning the things i just listed without kanji that would be useful and if not then what stage should i learn kanji at
"how did you all bring up your writing skills to those who already have a good command of the language more than  words or so in their passive vocabulary how did you transition into learning how to write them from memory 

calling to those especially who use anki and or completed rtk ive done rtk about  years ago"
please help me does anybody here have an romanized version of minna no nihongo
"problem with nn so i fully appreciate all of the flaws in the testing system for all languages not just the jlpt but i have recently fully experienced the flaws of the jlpt

in december of  i passed the jlpt n with a pretty good score  listening  reading  and  for kanjivocab 

i am nowhere near that level in practice ever since passing the n and throwing it on my gaijinpot resume i have been getting recruited to some new position about once a month and once things get to the interview stage it is made clear very quickly that my japanese is simply not good enough for the position involved

now i will say i think there are  flaws herethe gap between n and n is just to massive n is basically double the n

people overestimate the difficult of n i passed with  months of dedicated study after having never studied japanese properly just having lived here for  years

test taking techniques such as using context clues understanding question formatting for example on listening questions they will always lay out a red herring answer in the first  seconds or so before saying o no not really its this and lastly the ability to eliminate at least  and usually two complete outlier answers from a multiple choice question 

using these techniques i passed the test with relative ease and am left sitting with a qualification i dont deserve

ampxb

so having said all of that here is my question

as i start the plod to n so that i can put it on my resume how do i in practice become able to use the things i have been studying

and two as someone who has never studied japanese from a book how can i learn the proper grammar rules without boring myself to tears because right now when i read the true grammar rules for anything up to n level it just feels like yeah i know i know i know even though i dont completely know

i would like to pass n by december of  but i am starting to wonder if there is any meaning other than misrepresenting mysef"
"learning japanese  months of not learning japanese ive been dabbling into japanese for about  months ive probably done everything wrong largely wasted a big opportunity to learn the language and now i regret it i came here to share this experience so that others might not repeat these mistakes

i got introduced into japanese through pimsleur  and for the record pimsleur is such an addictive ego boosting method for learning any language  minutes in and you can say some phrases without even pausing to think about it  ive done the first  levels repeating each lesson  times trying to perfect my pronunciation which is the exact thing they advice against for around  months after that blazed through rosetta stones level  in about  weeks it was too easy thanks to pimsleur but it did teach me some vocab and grammar though did anyone tell them how boring their method is i also started watching anime from the first day i started listening to pimsleur and holy smokes anime is really addictive the sad part is i watched many shows with english subtitles and though it have been good practice for word retention i think i wasted the opportunity to put krashens theory into practice and use all that time to listen to japanese in japanese no subtitles this is literally how i spent the rest of my learning i didnt have and still dont have much time to spend on japanese and thats why i prefer easy methods like pimsleur and watching anime over more serious time commitments like reading a book or even following video lessons like those proposed by attain corps i followed their beginner seriespre n and was really put off by learning how to write the kana i learnt how to write the hiragana by cutting a youtube video about how to write them and putting it into anki and asking myself to remember the hiragana and how to write it from the romaji but have been putting off learning the katakana for ever

i also started learning kanji through wanikanis anki deck about  months ago got to around  kanji or the equivalent of level  but thats really the only thing ive learnt kanji only no vocabulary and i feel like the kanji i just learnt mean next to nothing in the real world other than them themselves being a better help to studying in context and just yesterday i found a great deck called tango n and i just fell in love with it that i deleted wanikanis vocab subdeck and put this one instead basically everything in there is a phrase i love this and today found another deck called glossika and i basically changed it into a sound on one side with an input field for you to write what you heard with the real phrase on the other side the english translation and an indication of how well accurate your writing was

i feel like i should be ashamed of myself this is not studying ive spent a long time stubbornly refusing to read or watch or search or even ask for any advice that last week when i started watching a youtube video about matt vs japan speaking about mass immersion and comprehensible input with stephen krashen i literally was about to cry because of all the time that was wasted literally doing nothing what made me even more depressed and sad was the fact that comprehensible input for japanese in particular is more than abundant there are about  websites at least all offering free comprehensible japanese stories some even propose the corresponding audio i mean wow the amount of nonsense anime i watched during the last  months since i started watching could very easily clock  heck even  hours

so this really revealed to me that i know nothing at all and that i should just look and ask for advice and because of that i came here asking for your advice youre most likely much more knowledgeable than i am and that makes your advice much more valuable than whatever i might come up with by myself

and thank you very much i know this is a long post but i really need to update what i think about language learning in general and how to learn japanese in particular"

"when kanji was almost abolished in japan this was a story i heard from my japanese teacher in university and recently i came across an essay written in japanese that talks about this event i wanted to share here warning the site where the essay is posted appears to be right wing leaning i don not care about the politics just wanted to translate the text because it is interesting

trampled japanese intelligence by nishi toshio 西鋭夫

conclusion of macarthurs cheerleading party

in a report made by delegation of education it is stated that japanese studentsno matter how smart and diligent they are despite the incredible amount of time allocated to remembering and writing kanji their results are to say the least discouraging

moreoverstudents who only graduate from grade school simply lack the necessary linguistic ability to function as member of a democratic society being unable to read common reading materials such as newspapers or tabloids also unable to comprehend contemporary questions and ideas that are in these texts on top of all that students after being able to read still unable to use their existing knowledge as an easy to use means to further their japanese learning abilitiesit concludes

according to the delegation of education japanese students after primary education unless they advance to higher school of learning they stop learning completely therefore average japanese people live their whole life as mentally twelve year old  macarthur also thought so

japanese is incompatible to democratic society

as far as the delegation of education concerned japanese language was a hurdle in japanese peoples development of course they never declared it as such euphemism was regularly being appliedkanji had some type of unique artistic merit that was impossible to convey to phonetic alphabet typessuch as latin alphabetthey acceptednevertheless kanji must be abolished a phonetic alphabet must be chosenredacted to become a democratic society and also to improve the international relations rather than kana latin alphabet will be a step more beneficialas they declared their intention

national illiteracy of japan

furthermoreas a result of the war a lot of foreigners have developed an extreme interest for japanese language and culture studies if we would like to meet this interest halfway and pull further interest developing a new writing system would accomplish a lotas the report concludes

this is not japanese saying for the sake of european and americans who have no real intention of learning ouch lets abolishing japanese lets live with latin alphabet this was a plan to kill kanji hiragana and katakana to sever the bonds of traditional culture from japan this was a plan to erase japan from history callednational illiteracy of japan

japanese languageis the essence of japanese culture trying to abolish it was an obvious attempt to belittle japanese people and disrespect japanese culture

translated from 

prosperous country weak people japanchapter  by nishi toshio 西鋭夫

translators note for those who wonder about how this was implemented basically a county wide kanji exam was held in us mandated japan after the ww this was to prove how high the illiteracy was and convince the population to abolish the use of kanji in the end the average student scored  and the project was scrapped now we are all paying the price"
building a solid foundation im brand new to learning the language for the most part  kanji on wanikani and three vocabulary lists in to genki i do all my reviews daily on wanikani but i find that i have had to take a pause on the lessons because i was struggling to keep up with the kunyomi is that normal also i signed up for a beginner japanese course with the japan society will i be able to build a solid foundation with these methods is there anything else you can recommend i would like to be fluent in realistically  years student teaching  graduate classes primarily limit my mental capacity and time unfortunately so if im missing a more effective way to learn please feel free to make some suggestions

"why i quit ajatt forever three years ago it was mid during the height of the war between ajatters and traditional learners i was part of a small platoon of ajatters that included many of the original ajatters and mattvsjapan was in charge we had direct orders from khatz himself to perform a raid on a small community post in rlearnjapanese

we went in armed with inputhypothesis rhetoric and links to ajatt articles and videos of khatz speaking they were just simple folk unarmed with languageacquisition theory and they werent ready for the surprise attack

it was brutal we left no one alive so to speak i saw small weebs as young as  figuratively massacred before my very eyes it makes me sick just thinking about it

we stopped eventually but matt in a frenzy wouldnt stop  he just kept going destroying them with input theory long after theyd surrendered there was an innocent girl of  who believed you could get fluent from genki textbooks matt took her and started redpilling her forcibly over and over again britvsjapan in tears by now begged matt to stop but he wouldnt we all just watched on in horror

most of us were young and naive when we originally signed up for ajatt little did we know of the fear and the atrocities we would be forced to commit in the name of inputbased learning after that day i never touched another japanese book or drama again i still sometimes wake up in a panic after reliving that day in my nightmares"

"i just finished watching my first anime usagi drop fully in japanese i also read urashima taro im sooo psyched like when i started the anime i didnt know that much vocab just knew like a hundred words from genki  and jpod after episode  i found i could understand like  of the episode without needing english subtitles the anime has short easy to understand sentences and grammar and i found learning vocab from it a breeze using animelon plus it was a very heartwarming and wholesome fatherdaughter story definitely recommended as a starter anime for people learning japanese

i also read urashima taro from the bilingual japanese stories book when i started it was really hard to read even  sentences and it took  minutes to understand everything it took me a month just to get to page  but then something happenedsomething clicked i ended up reading the nd page in a week and finished the rd in one sitting it was a good exercise in grammar and learning vocab but i feel anime is way better because it is more entertaining will read the next story yuki onna later when i run out of anime 

i also tried reading manga but it was way to hard cumbersome actually not knowing kanji i had to ocr every word i didnt know which was literally every word and then search jisshokenkyusha i think itd be more accessible if i had a kanji dictionary or a dictionary app a dictionary would also help me with learning kanji

ha i dont even know the point of this post reallyim just excited and wanted to share my progress with people whod understand  im also looking for anime recommendations which are easy to understand currently im watching natsume yuujinchou its simple and a good resource for learning vocab for a beginner like usagi drop ill try barakamon next as it also has quiet characters plus slice of life story so i hope itll be easy to follow as well

also i promise there is a reason i am telling you all this first instead of just asking the question lol 

so i thought as a gift i would get him for his birthday this year a new gym bag that he uses for his multiple gis and other sport equipment but i want to get it embroidered with his name but his name in japanese 

i like kanji as it has different meanings which i also know can be an issue when naming because it can create a difference in how its pronounced or the way people think of it 

so i thought i would reach out and see if anyone here that speaks japanese and knows kanji could proofread my idea of his name

his name is daniel which in japanese is danieru 

so i looked up the symbols for da ni e ru 

can someone tell me if the following is correct

 daniel is in fact danieru
 danieru is broken up as da ni e ru
 i can use this as a way to create a name for him in kanji by using the symbols that correlate 

if you have got this far and i am correct awesome so on to step  getting the correct kanji symbols understanding their meaning and 

most importantly that they make sense together and that you would know his name is daniel or danieru 

so here is what i came up with

打仁衛琉

打  da  to strike or hit also used in baseball terminology 

仁  ni  humanity virtue benevolence 


衛  e  defense protection

琉  ru  lapis lazuli precious stone also used in reference to other words associated with okinawa where isshinryu was created 

if you read any of the above info about him i am sure you can guess why i picked the symbols that i picked 

so now is there real questions 

is this correct as in symbols and reads the name danieru  does it make sense or does it read something weird and im wrong about it all 

please help"
is  minutes of studying per day too little i am kind of at a cross roads right now usually i study chinese mandarin for  hour per day and japanese for  hour per day these hours do not include watching dramas with japanesechinese subtitles however i will soon have a lot less free time and i may have to cut down to only  hour of studying per day my initial plan was to divide this hour into  minutes of chinese and  minutes of japanese i have been studying both languages for about  years now and passed hsk for chinese i want to say roughly n equivalent test for chinese possibly lower and i was hoping to take n this year for japanese i really dont want to give up learning either language but im afraid a half hour per day may be too little to continue making progress in both that being said i watch dramas every day so i technically will be exposed to much more than just minutes per day but in terms of dedicated studying will the half hour be enough or should i give up one of the languages that im studying

"does anyone else have a habit of not reading a sentence because of the abundance of kanji in it not looking for advice so technically ive been learning japanese for over a decade now though until  most of my learning was via the shitty elementaryhigh school curriculum and watching anime so i dont know whether that counts or not

my level is a bit between n and n i could pass the n test easily and im good at n listeningvocab  some kanji but i struggle with it more so im obviously still a beginner but im a bit worried about my reading skills listening is my strongest point and i can listen fairly easily to n conversations grammar im decent at for my level but reading is a big issue for me especially when its at a level higher than n

i know a decent amount of kanji and can tell what a lot are based on context but whenever its actually time to read text i start getting overwhelmed by it the more dense the kanji is like the more strokes it has the worse my comprehension is

kanji like 中 or 人 arent an issue as theyre fairly simple and i see words  like 日本語 all the time so i have no problem with that but if i sit down and read texts like these i struggle a lot with it not just because its too high of a level for me but also because i just scan through to look at the kana and kanji i can easily spot then i give up and do something else because i get too lazy to properly look at the more complicated kanji even words i know well like 図書館 to me it blends in with the rest of the kanji because its longer and the characters have more strokes than other ones

i learn japanese in high school and we mainly write online or at least we write online first then put it onto 原稿用紙 im a perfectionist and tend to overcomplicate things for myself by trying to write japanese that i dont even know so i rely on dictionaries for new words as well as my teacher for feedback my class is a bit of a mess as everyone is at different levels so were allowed to write in hiragana though kanji is preferred im the best at japanese there surprising cause im terrible compared to people on this sub so i always put everything in kanji if it needs it plus im sure its easier on my teachers eyes but the thing is that while i know the meaning of my sentences i often find myself not knowing how to pronounce a lot of the kanji i write and it can be an issue if i need to read it out loud

for example a few months ago we had to do a unit on school rules in my country vs japan and one thing we did was make a quiz about the rules in my country then talk online in japanese to tokyo high school students about it for one of my answers i wrote

gt 先生は休んだら非常勤の先生は授業を教えますたいてい非常勤の先生は何も知らなくてふつうの先生は指示を出します先生の監督だけが必要だから時々他のクラスに入っていますが一般的じゃないです

honestly speaking now and even back then i cant understand some of the most important kanji in that paragraph and now its even worse since i dont remember what i wrote back then i had to make notes on my phone with the furigana above so i could properly read it out even attempting to read it is difficult for me and its pretty bad that i cant even understand my own writing even if its something i know all the kanji for like this

gt 休み時間に外か売店の近くでいなければなりませんだから授業中だけ教室にいて授業中に食べるのは失礼です休み時間に忙しくて食べることができなくて食べたいなら食べ終わるまで教室の外にいてください

since it looks fairly dense at a glance i give up before i even start

i think part of the problem is that im not able to make any of these sentences myself without a dictionary so it doesnt feel like something i wrote but i also think i just suck at reading since im too lazy with it its frustrating cause even if a sentence was all in kana id have an even harder time because of trying to differentiate the words

i was wondering if anyone else has or has had a similar problem since i usually see people say they have more trouble with listening or speaking but since i do a lot of that sort of study eg watching anime listening to music or speaking to myself as practice its the opposite for me"
why arent the japanese and chinese variants of直and other differing characters seperate unicode points im really confused about this its so frustrating that with some fonts it gets displayed one way and on other fonts it gets displayed another way its not just about style there are a lot of characters that substantially differ in form between japan and china so why arent they all officially considered different it seems like it would avoid a lot of confusion

ive been looking into getting a tutor but paying  an hour seems crazy to me its probably one of the best ways but it still seems impossible especially with a pandemic going on

but yeah i dont want to half ass learning japanese i get crap from my family but i dont pay attention to them i want to learn because i think its a beautiful language and id love to learn something new

if anyone has any recommendations id really appreciate it i want to actually learn japanese fully and not just for travel i might get the chance to live there in the future so i want to fully immerse myself in the japanese language"
"advice on forgetting grammar points while in conversation  hello   
i am hitting sort of a plateau or mental wall here essentially i have been trying to use more advanced grammar points but i end up forgetting them in conversation practice i can understand these points when i read or listen to them but when i am in a conversation i end up forgetting them sometimes i will realize after my lessons or after a conversation that i could have used that point i will end up reviewing it and practicing it but then next time i could have ended up using it i forget it it seems i end up reverting to my old grammar points that i have learned in genki i and ii as well as some of the early grammar points in tobira    
i end up having  or  hour lessons of conversation practice a week i usually read about  minutes a day as well as various things i listen to but i just end up not being able to use them any advice from intermediate learners out there should i do more writing practice more speaking practice im kind of at a loss here i am aware of plateaus but man i have felt like this for a good  to  months just seeing what things have worked for people and what helped them use other grammar points and i guess that includes vocab that they know but end up forgetting in conversation   


any help is appreciated"

"help me pick between these two language schools in tokyo akamonkai vs isi takadanobana or recommend a better one please i hope this post can help others looking into these two schools as well

my level finished textbooks up to tobira currently working on kanzen master n grammar books and sentence mining

looking for super intensive language school im talking about schools that are designed to help you learn the language as fast as possible not those schools that are designed for you to have a blast and experience japan while studying some japanese on the sideive already lived in japan for  years teaching english and experienced the whole thing not i just want to perfect my japanese

duration up to  years

akamonkai ive read some reviews here on reddit and other places stating that it is quite intensive here i actually want a place with a lot of work to do after class homework and possible career support after 

isi ive head its a good school but its not very intensive theres a lot of fun events to do and thats great and all but like i said before ive done a lot of that already

anyone with experience at any of these schools please tell me about your experience"

gtlearn  jlptn vocab with pictures 

they also come with notes on culture and how to use the words in certain situations

a bit of back story

a little bit of background i speak english and japanese but i have to admit my range of english vocabulary is far greater than my japanese vocabulary 単語 たんご while there are already great resources out there wanikani genki etc that offer kinaesthetic and audial learning approaches i felt a visual approach could add something new of course not all words are suited for learning with pictures  abstract concepts are particularly difficult to visualise  but after a bit of research i found a good amount of words are amenable to visual learning so over the course of months i attached images to individual words all while exercising my understanding of englishjapanese to pick the most appropriate pictures ive already labelled  words with pictures its been a lot of work and theres still many more to be done but i wanted to share some of the words i managed to label so far in the form of free ebooks please note im only just starting out with this project and these two ebooks are tasters for a more complete picture dictionary 図鑑 ずかん they cover a fraction of all the words in the japanese language but i hope the ebooks serve as a useful guide to get started

whats next

provided this sort of thing is interesting to you  im looking to create more resources eg ebooks with anime vocabulary and an app to help you learn words visually via srs and games thats the longterm plan

your feedback

i would love to hear from you whether visual resources like the above are interesting to you if you think they dont add much to your learning thats equally helpful feedback 

you feedback will motivate me to continue developing this project further

thank you"
"importance of nuance in studying i use anki and bunpro as my main studying tools and ive frequently run into the common trap of two similar grammar points 漢字 etc as to be expected of learning any language 

i recently had an interesting conversation on the bunpro forums regarding  だす vs はじめる which both have a similar meaning but different nuance if you enter one of these when bunpro is expecting the other it asks you to correct it rather than just marking it incorrect outright 

i personally think that mistaking one for the other should mark it as incorrect but several users on the site told me not to worry about it or that im trying too hard am i off base what are your thoughts"
i just finished persona  scramble my second game in japanese i just wanted to share with the community that i finished another game in japanese it was tons of fun really difficult but well worth it if theres any questions regarding this please lmk if there are others here who have finished the game i would like to discuss the game here or in private chat and see how the experience was for others
"italki if you can afford it i cannot recommend it enough for conversation practice ive seen italki mentioned a couple times around these parts but i wanted to emphasize that it is something especially those of you studying on your own without a formal classroom setting should consider at some point there are  japanese teacherstutors on the website that you can hire hourly or through a package multiple lessons for a reduced price a lesson can generally be anything you want many teachers will be happy to accommodate your specific requests but the main thing here is it gives you an opportunity to practice speaking the language which imo is crucial 

ive had a few sessions and they have been very positive last session my tutor and i went over a test based on genki i ive just finished genki i and before that we had a free conversation class all positive experiences 

having said that i would only recommend italki if you are at a stage where you feel you could do the n or n test anything lower than that is probably too soon as you couldnt really keep a conversation going with such limited knowledge of the language some teachers specifically wont offer free conversation classes until intermediate level n but many others are happy to chat with beginners

for me i took my first lesson right after finishing genki i i plan to go through at least one conversation practice class a week i think thats fair at this early stage 

tldr if youve been studying on your own and havent already consider giving italkicom a shot great tool for conversation practice with native teachers"
how long does it take for rtk method to take effect i was already about  kanji in when i started rtk and i think i have learned an additional  since then how long does it take until i can start seeing the effects i am having the issue where i can recognize the meaning of the kanji whenever it comes up in my review but often cannot recall it when i see it in the wild is this normal do you have to review a kanji on anki until it matures before you can start recognizing it in the wild
"weird kanji and furigana in manga first of all i gotta say that im still a beginner on japanese
but just as japanese isnt my native language neither is english and something that helped me alot with english was reading comics
so i decided to look for raw manga to read specifically dragon ball given that i read it  times and although i wouldnt understand most of it i could still enjoy it
but then i came across something that really bothered me toriyamas hand writing and weird choices for what reading to use on its furigana
i know that im just a beginner and i barely know  kanjis but some of his kanji i couldnt find the meaning anywhere and the choice to write the furigana for 里 as ロ for example doesnt help given that the usual reading for that kanji is り

anyway i would like to know if any you ever had that problem of not finding the meaning for a kanji using its weird furigana"
"ateji rules and misconceptions to know in order to avoid bad decisions this is from an article on how to choose baby names in ateji there is much more but i only took the relevant parts to education it has enlightened me about ateji a little i hope itll be useful to you guy as well i am sorry if there are any mistakes i am studying japanese myself here is the link to original article 

what is ateji

ateji is the act of separating kanji from its original meaning and borrowing their sound or reading to attach them to other words such as attaching characters to words that dont exist in kanji 亜米利加americaor珈琲coffeefor example usually established to be used by politicians or literary scholars or scientists

also another type of ateji uses the meaning of kanji but changes its reading生活くらしliving in native japaneseや紅葉もみじmaple in native japanese秋桜コスモスcosmos  latin name of the flowerfor example it can be said that ateji is an ancient japanese cultural phenomena it is also very useful for contextualizing foreigners names 

cases of ateji naming

in japan there are cases where ateji is used to name children it may be difficult to determine which name is ateji for exampleあゆみinstead of歩may be written as亜由見word by word basis people may have different opinions about if it constitutes ateji just by making a name more complex

if you have already chosen a name and having trouble to find appropriate kanji you can search by hiragana to find candidate characters from the site in the link 

rules of ateji

there are number of rules regarding naming in japan for example in naming there are commonly used characters and there are unusable characters characters that can be used in names are the standardized  daily use characters常用漢字 andor characters that are established to use in names人名用漢字 examples such as 薔薇ばらor棗なつめwhile can be used in names wont be allowed on legal documents 

not only kanji but katakana and hiragana can also be used in names however latin alphabet or  other foreign alphabets cannot be used 

in legal documents there maybe limits on characters but there are no defacto rules about reading as an extreme example a name written太郎 male namecan be read asはなこ female nameif chosen as ateji and there wont be a problem legally using that name also好機can be read asチャンスchanceor青空can be read asスカイskyso english readings can also be used in ateji naming with their katakana spellings since there are no established limitations there are lots of variations in naming it may require a lot of imagination to come up with a unique ateji

avoiding problems when choosing ateji names

there maybe no rules yet it must be stated that common sense should be used in order to avoid problems for the recipients of the name and those around them things like choosing in direct opposites such as writing赤redbut reading it asしろwhiteor writing空skybut reading asだいちgroundbetter be avoided

characters with very negative meanings should also be avoided finishedおわるdarknessやみsicknessやまいfearおそれtype of words must not be used even if there is no rule against it using a character just because you like the visual appearance or just because it sounds right to you and disregarding the negativity surrounding the character is also a bad idea

for example characters like depression鬱madness狂perversion変should not be used in naming even if they sound or look good difficult to write characters might be very problematic when choosing characters it is better if the character is easy to understand and easy to remember"

"rtk speedrun idea from a complete beginner hello this is my first post in this subreddit so feedback would be much appreciated   


i wanted to be productive during my month break from uni so i figured that i might as well learn japanese in the meantime since im in love with memorizing i wanted to start with memorizing kanji characters rtk has been very helpful in recognizing the vague meanings of each character and how to write them so i adopted that however i havent been devoting much time to learning the kanji  hour each day  kanji per hour for the past  days and i wanted to ask if speedrunning the book in  days roughly around  hours each day would be beneficial and if anyone has actually done that before   


based on cursory glances from various internet forums much of the flak against rtk is rooted in the time you initially need to invest to just get a vague meaning of each individual kanji character and learn the strokes which people think isnt worth it however if you could go through rtk at a rapid pace with decent recall are there any other particular reasons why one shouldnt use rtk   


if you guys think its a good idea im more than willing to spend the next  days just hyperfocused on memorizing the jōyō kanji and inform you guys whether its actually feasible or not hopefully this endeavor can serve as a benchmark for how quickly can you actually go through rtk to lessen the amount of time you need to invest in completing the book if it is indeed feasible maybe it can alleviate peoples worries of spending too much time in the method in fear of it all being a waste if ever ill make a second post discussing how much i can recall and its effectiveness altogether   


  
 context im a memory athlete a person that memorizes competitively internationally i became a grandmaster of memory at the age of  currently  and memorizing is something i find really fun so regardless of the practicality of memorizing kanji characters for learning the japanese language im just treating it as one of my memory endeavors"

"review on textbooks and workbooks i usedhave been using for studying japanese intermediate level tobira textbook 上級へのとびら

impression

tobira covers pretty much all grammars you need for n and some of n it can be both used for class with a tutor or self study though not every excercise is possible without guidance of a teaching person or a group of learners

pro

 relatively long texts free audio good for both reading and listening

 a lot of the texts are about japanese culture so you can learn about both the language and the culture at the same time

 vocabulary list for every lesson very practical

 different forms of texts written language dialogs even manga

 explanation and examples for grammar points are pretty detailed

contra

 the cultural aspect covered in tobira is rather general you might not be able to learn a lot of new things about japanese culture therefore the texts could be boring for some people

 one lesson takes a lot of time if you go through it extensively so if you dont have much timeattention span at once it could be hard to decide how to separate the content into two or more sessions since the grammar part covers new grammars all texts at once

progress finished

ampxb

tobira grammar power 上級へのとびら これで身につく文法力

impression

perfect accompaniment for the textbook a must in my opinion if you want to learn how to apply the grammar you studied in tobira

pro

 lots of excercises great opportunity to pratice and to see if you really understood everything from the textbook

contra

 the sample solutions are not always useful since you are often required to write your own sentences perfect to use with a tutor who can check if your sentences are correct though

progress finished

ampxb

try n トライ日本語能力試験n

impression

very short texts many grammar points questions for every lesson

pro

 no translation of the grammar but explanation both in japanese and english since grammar structures often cannot be translated precisely could be a contra too though

 its a text and workbook

 lots of grammar points altogether  grammar structures

contra

 mostly only multiple choice questions for pratice

 texts are really short longer texts would be good for understanding the context better

progress  lessons finished

ampxb

 essential japanese expressions  a guide to correct usage of key sentence patterns どんな時どう使う 日本語表現文型

impression

nn mostly n grammar expressions structured by topics in  lessons

pro

 every lesson covers a situation where different grammars can be used and explains the differences between them pretty practice orientated

 can be used by n and n learners especially those who use japanese often and aim to improve their speaking or writing for example at work or on sns

contra

 though it says nn its mostly n rarely new grammars for someone whos already on n level though a good opportunity to revise old grammars

 like in try the questions dont require answers in full sentences good for self study but not really a challenge

progress  lesson finished started recently

ampxb

日本文化を読む

impression

long texts several pages for advanced learners n n

different topics and different kinds of texts short story reportage comment etc

pro

 available in printed and as audio cd good for both reading and listening

 it covers a broad spectrum of topics a good chance to improve vocabulary

contra

 some of the texts could be boring because of the length if you are not interested in the subject at all and many of them dont have anything to do with japanese culture

progress  texts read i couldnt find the cds till this week

the issue however is that im not sure what to do in terms of material after graduation this coming semester ill be starting tobira for my class but wont end of finishing it because my class doesnt cover the entire book in one semester im considering reading genki  before continuing the rest of tobira since my classes only covered  of genki  and the entire irodori series but my knowledge is so scattered and from so many places im not sure exactly what to do 

im still going to be doing wanikani until i eventually hit  level  now do all the bunpro exercises and do my anki decks but i feel like i need a good resource that i can utilize all these supplementary resources to put me on a good track since i fear forgetting the kanji grammar and vocan studying in isolation from these tools have any suggestions anything is appreciated really thanks"

"a guide in japanese on how to learn english through immersion that can be applied to learn japanese how to learn english guide for japanese in japanese

this guide was very fun to read the biggest problem when learning a language is to spend too much time reading on how to learn the language and not actually learning the language this is the perfect solution  because the guide is for japanese people and in japanese so at the same time youre practicing japanese  also the guide is saying that the most important thing is to immerse spending the maximum of time with the language watching japanese content the rest shouldnt be your priority like grammar even if you dont like the the method in the guide its still a fun read "
"long post getting to n level japanese within a year thru intensive learning in japan for work im about jlpt n level now have been learning for the past  months onoff but i have mandarin background from middlehigh school so taking in kanji wasnt too bad for me i am thinking of taking a gap year in my career to study japanese intensively for a year in japan to get to n level which i assume is the level required by most positions to get going in japan

about me

currently im working in us tech sector now some of you might wonder why the hell would this dumbass throw away a comfortable life in us working in overpaid as hell tech just to livework in japan man i wish i could stay but my year post graduate work permit is ending soon and in the last  work visa lottery i did not get selected and im not too optimistic on winning it this april currently im looking at other options around the world and seriously considering japan

am i a weeb well depends how you see it my parents both met and went to college in japan no im not born there and my dad got a high enough position in mitsui but asked to relocate back to my home country since he felt its better to raise a family back home ive been to japan for almost a dozen times now to accompany my dad on assignmentsvacation to meet my relatives who have chosen to stay and live there am always interested to live in japan since i love the food cleanliness etc japan is actually a nightmare yeah my parentsrelatives said be prepared to experience the bad side if i ever start living there but always pushed me to consider japan as my next destination but i never got into learning japanese until a few months into quarantine a year ago

okay back to the topic

ive just started looking around and it looks like the most popular longterm intensive courses start from yr  months all the way to  years cost strongly varies so ill leave that to discussion is it possible to acquire n level proficiency within a year and a half or less i plan to start the program in  so i can maybe study more intensively to n level once my work permit is up in august or when covid finally slows down and japan takes in students again

location wise i was thinking tokyo but my goal really is to actually learn and be able to use it not just acquire the n certificate then bugger off so im also thinking going to smaller cities like nagoyafukuokahiroshimakobe since i think there is too much distraction in tokyo so im also looking for the optimal learning environment i was hoping there is someone here who have participated in a similar program who could share their experience and recommendations

cost wise im looking to spend less than usdk a year if possible but i can stretch that

i hope you guys can answer these questions too

how is the job market looking in tokyo i have almost  years of experience as a bianalytics professional working in a softbank vision funded startup ive browsed and applied to several positions and most replies told me my qualifications are pretty good but japanese is a requirement despite an intl working environment that was a reply from an american company btw will acquiring n solve my problem with this

step  get heisigs rtk and complete it

step  get rtk book  and complete it

when starting step  i will also be doing this using the kodansha kanji learners dictionary i learn the useful combination kanji for each of the  kanji instead of learning the kun and on readings

and while doing all of that i will be reading as much japanese as i can listening speaking to myself unfortunately i dont live in japan and also using tae kims guide to japanese grammar i will also be using anki for the two rtk books

right now i am halfway through th grade and hope to be fluent by the time i am halfway through th grade i am very motivated about this so i expect decently quick progress especially in the summer

so can anyone please tell me if 

 this method will actually lead to fluency
 if yes this method is good then is my time frame realistic and is there a way to improve on it
 if this method is trash then please tell me a way "

"origin of kamehameha dragon ball and japanese appreciation post so yeah thats a pretty frickin sweet thing i stumbled upon while weebing around the web and i thought why not share it somewhere

so at the time akira toriyama was trying to come up with a name for an attack containg turtle in japanese kame 亀 since master roshi was in fact the master of the turtle

his wife after a trip to the hawaii suggest him to use the name of a local historical king kamehameha

now thats were it gets pretty sweet following the hawaiian folklore and history the very name of the king kamehameha  i meant the very lonely one since he escaped his death sentence as an infant and grew up in exile 

coincidentally master roshi himself was know in the story as the turtle hermit 亀仙人  かめせんにん and lives as a matter of factbefore the start of the story alone in a island in the middle of nowhere the very lonely one indeed

but the coolest thing is that if you take the romanic kamehameha and turn them into japanese kanji and hiragana what you end up with is this

thats how it is normally written in the manga かめはめ波

that first part kameかめ means turtle 亀 as mentioned before and its basically the main symbol of master roshi

the middle part hame はめ comes from the japanese word 破滅 hametsu which means ruin destruction

the last part ha 波  is the kanji for wave

so what you end up with is turtle destruction wave pretty spot on i would say

i know that probably since its dragon ball it must be a very know funfact already but it helped reminding me of how we tend to forget that under everyones childhood and crazily stupid powerscaling the core of the first dragon ball actually  had masterfully crafted storytelling 
there must be a reason why it literally shaped an era after all

so yeah dont bully me and keep learning japanese do something with the  anime you watch shitty otaku and yeah whoever tells you that its tedious or boring is just a fucking liar learning kanji is probably the most interesting thing of my  the way that every single character is deeply rooted to the history and culture is simply something that us as westerner cant experience with our own languages and its a pity trust me thanks for your time see ya boyzz"

today ive reviewed  cards in  hours according to anki statistics abd i still have  cards left to review today for the last  weeks or so i had dropped trying to memorize the readings and just focus on the meanings of kanji words and even though reviewing cards is much easier i dont get the readings and therefore i wont be able to pick up any words ive learned when doing listening immersion ive also taken my new cards per day down from  to  just to make it a little easier and if i feel like a word just wont stick today ill just pass it and hope it will the next day

i know you get a lot more out of memorizing both readings and meaning since ive done that before and it works way better than to just memorize the meanings and i know no pain no gain or what ever but i dont think doing anki reviews should be this painful and annoying to do

what im asking is if theres anything i could do to make this much easier less time consuming and less painful ive already taken my new cards per day down know the importans of leaning both readings and meanings and have a technique for if words just wont stick"

"fantastic origins of simple words 馬鹿 does it just mean fool or is there something much more when i was laughing a terrible tattoo picture of some one who wrote 馬鹿 on their neck it suddenly occurred to me that i actually didnt know much about such a common word 

one google search later i found this article 何でバカって言うの from what i understand

most people think the term is originated in qing dynasty when zhao gao who became the grand chancellor after the death of chin shi huang in order to exercise his authority over the successor emperor showed him a deer and insisted of calling it a horse henceforth the term was coined as 馬鹿 turns out however this was just a popular myth just like hundreds that surround history 

there are many ideas on the origins of the term 

one theory is that its actually originated in sanskrit words for ignorant moha 慕何 and knowing nothing mahallaka 摩訶羅 and introduced to japanese by budist monks who used sanskrit as a secret language 

another theory suggests that it is derived from similar sounding chinese word for house destroyer 破家 which because of the above mentioned myth usually written as 馬鹿 

the last theory on the article is my favorite one it says it was derived from the emphasized version of the wordはかないas it was used in the tale of genji it meant being young and ill advised and then later became the common word for fool in japan

i really dont think that was such a bad choice for a tattoo now that i know more"

"learning katakana id like your feedback on a website im making im very much a beginner or perhaps barely even started yet with learning japanese i had been trying a few different resources to try to learn katakana amp hiragana but found that a lot of them were kind of giving me the answers rather than making me try to read real words i decided to try putting together a small website or webapp to help me learn katakana

the first version is almost ready and i was wondering if there might be a few people who want to learn or are already learning katakana who would like to try it out and let me know how it is the site focuses on reading only english words written in katakana so no other japanese learning experience is not a problem at all

im happy to share the site more publicly once i feel its ready but for now im hoping to just find a few beginners who want to try it out and provide feedback its free amp theres no sign up or anything like that just a simple little resource trying to make learning katakana a bit more efficient"

"any idea why katakana isnt hiragana but with some modification just curious not to be critic of any language but while learnig japanese i couldnt help myself to wonder why hiragana wasnt modified with something to make katakana it has the exact same sounds and structure i mean wouldt it be significantly easier to learn and remember 

also im intrigued if while hiragana stays the same would katakana ever expand in sounds i mean katakana is specifically used for foreign terms so would it ever include foreign sounds

to my knowledge every language adapts through time through adding new words deleting some words and even adapting their alphabets by adding modifying andor deleting lettersyllables so it is interesting to me if this would be the case for the japanese language in the future

just from doing some basic research i have noticed that learning hiragana is where i need to start the starter guide talks about using anki to learn hiragana and ill be honest i havent used anki before but i thought it was basically a flash card system i would be learning from my phone so i would have to pay the  for the app which is fine however if it is a flash card system i guess i dont understand how i would learn from it if i have no previous knowledge it seems like it would be a confusing mess can someone educate me on this or is there maybe like a youtube series that would prepare me for starting to use anki for japanese or just learning hiragana in general

"i watched a jojo episode  times to learn japanese and was surprised to see how well it worked i also made a video of it which goes over the main details 

but i want to share the experience here with some extra thoughts attached to it

for some context 
i think one of my biggest weaknesses right now when it comes to japanese is my listening ability  when ive tried watching japanese content without japanese subtitles ive struggled to pick up most of the content even though i might have known majority if not all the words my japanese vocab size is a bit over  words right now 

so i decided to try listening to the same episode over and over again  times instead of just once for this i chose the second episode of jojo for me its an exiting fun episode which is important to make this method enjoyable

 on the st watch while i did notice a lot of words which i knew it wasnt enough for me to comprehend the dialogue properly

 on the nd watch i already felt like i was understanding a good chunk more than on the first listen and started noticing words which i clearly hadnt learned yet

 after that i kept on listening picking up more and more on every single listen and only on the th listen did i start to feel like im starting to exhaust my current vocabulary

 on the th listen i finally checked the script and to my surprise i still had so many words which i had learned but didnt pick up through listening alone

 on the th listen i made anki cards for all the words which i didnt know i ended up creating about  cards this was vital for me as after i had made and taken all the cards it was a night and day difference between listening comprehension also i want to know how the word is written for reading

 to keep it shorter from there to the th listen it was just about improving my ability to pick up the dialogue through listening and making a bit of progress every watchthrough

by the end i had indeed acquired not plainly memorized the entire episodes dialogue  meaning that my japanese genuinely improved to the extent that i am now able to watch that episode
understanding and hearing pretty much everything as i also learned  new words

i also noticed that my listening had improved even outside of this episode its by no means perfect now but to me it feels like there is at least a noticeable difference and my listening leveled up thanks to it

but i noticed something else which i didnt think about at all at first is that because i had heard all the lines so many times they got stuck in my head kind of like a song that youve heard too many times which means that i am able to recall those lines with minimal mental latency  when i think of a word which happened to be in the dialogue instantly some quote from the anime alongside its pronunciation jumps into my head and that i feel is the true power of watching the same content multiple times

and thats just with one episode i feel like if i were to do this with    different episodes it would have incredible benefits imo even more than watching many unique episodes only once unless youre already at a very high level

however if i were to do this again id do it differently

  times for one episode is probably an overkill as it hits diminishing returns it might be better to watch it at least  to  times and however many times you want after that as enjoying the process is also very important and after that move on to some other episode
 check the japanese script earlier the first few times watch it without japanese subtitles trying to pick up as you can by listening but check the script early because as i also talked about in the video more in detail before i checked the script i had heard some words wrongly and i had a very hard time getting my brain to hear them correctly afterwards as the wrong version was already so ingrained in my head on top of that checking the script earlier amp making anki cards for the words which you dont know will probably drastically speed up the rate at which you get value out of the episode
 consider playing around with the spacing of your watchthroughs you can even try multiple episodes at once you can try making an audio playlist of episodes you can passivelyactively listen to
uryansmallwood has even suggested trying to space out engagement with media in an srs pattern

i suppose many of you have already tried this method of listening to the same piece of content over and over again but i feel like its still kind of underutilizedseldom talked about i can also understand not everyone liking this kind of approach but its not the worst i think the trick is to find content which you enjoy listening to something which is music to your ears maybe there was an episode of anime you watched long ago and want to have an excuse to revisit again and again as it was for me with the second jojo episode then i think it would serve as a great starting point for this method"

"how many sources should a japanese learner be using how to incorporate anki independent study hello lot of questions here

i have been using genki  over the past few weeks learning vocab and grammar i am currently on chapter  learning the te form i am at a stand still because i am trying to structure my future studies with this language 

so my current pathway plan is genki   genki   an integrated approach to intermediate japanese  tobira gateway to advanced japanese new authentic japanese progressing from intermediate to advanced japanese 

this i think is a very traditional approach but i would also like to have a secondary sub route that i will study as well that can get me on my feet speaking and reading native material much quicker right now i just have tae kims grammar guide in this category which i heard is a nontraditional approach i also heard bunpro is good but it is very expensive with the current traditional book plan genki to new authentic japanese is bunpro overkill i still plan to do tae kims since it is free even if genki covers its lessons after i finish genki   and tae kims guide i plan of branching to native material

does the traditional route i listed above cover both academic japanese as well as everyday casual japanese 

then comes the question of how to use anki i read a source that kk anki deck from djt is a good way to learn should i start using it now or until i finish genki series and tae kims guide to get the most out of it so far i have been using anki for each genki lesson to learn vocab 

where is a good source to get free native reading materials for learners around the genki  stage with tae kims guide completed

thats it i think

i thank you all in advance thank you

feel free to give suggestions i really want to take the best route with this language"

"is reviewing a word before the srs interval is up detrimental to learning in the long term the point of an srs algorithm is to teach you a word then wait until you have almost forgotten the word before reintroducing it to you doing this encourages your brain to store that word in your longterm memory instead of keeping it in the shortterm

im currently using wanikani with great success but i also want to use an anki deck nayr k on top of it im pretty far along in wanikani so its not that the reviews havent started piling up yet ive just set an intensive routine for myself since wanikani has its own set pace which is very strict my vocab acquisition feels quite slow compared to my intensive study schedule and id like to increase it 

however inevitably i assume a lot of words in wanikani and nayr k will overlap since both cover around  most common words in the language 

my question is will learning a new word on wanikani when i have already learned it in anki  reviewing a word on anki when ive already reviewed it on wanikani etc be detrimental to learning

it might sound counterintuitive since im technically studying more but i vaguely remember hearing somewhere that its better to just stick with one system at a time so that the srs algorithm can actually do what it was designed to do i just cant find the source"

ive tried to use some graphical identifiers but they dont work at all in this case

the overall quality of the graphic doesnt help as its contained within a x texture the first graphic is the original one the second comes from a fan project that upgraded the texture quality however it also changed the contents of some assets which is apparenly the case here the third shows the overall surroundings

some context that could help identifyingtranslating the sign is located on earth nearby a virtual training area and recruitment center on the side of the building up high this building also has a happy noodle advertisment sign on top of it and that restaurant is apparently placed at its bottom there is also a sandman audio sign nearby

"my experience with japanesepod premium plus and learning so far reviewing apps and such so this may be a long post or redundant to some others but everyones experience can be unique or valuable to someone else especially when programs and sites updated the post wont be 
so to start i will say i have only been learning for about  months and only seriously for  my goal is to one day live in japan while communicating on a fluentnativeish level that being said also smaller goals like watching anime and listening to music as well maybe read some manga i am  and work a full time job and dont have a ton of free time so self study with apps and sites is the best i can do for now though i am looking into setting up a schedule to immerse more ajatt 

ok now onto the meat of the post i signed up for japanesepod because they seemed to have a ton of resources and people seemed to like said resources there is an over abundance of information on where to start so i just started there with the premium not plus this was coming up on the holidays so they have a ridiculous marketing strategy and campaign but i read about the my teacher part of premium plus and decided a teacher may help expedite things especially how they advertise it upon signing up they ask you to read the manual which i did and to write an introduction about yourself in japanese yo what now mind you at this point i had done about  lessons and could say my name and that i like stuff thats it so thats what i did the teacher corrected the one grammatical error i made and then they ask you to also send a voiced intro so i just came up with like  more basic sentences and did that the teacher said good job i have not interacted with them since this is crazy i havent gotten a lesson plan they send me assignments that i cant do because im an absolute beginner at even their lowest level that being said the lessons notes  vocabulary cards and transcripts are all super helpful but they were there before plus i think that the plus portion of jpod is just not for beginners like am i going to ask my teacher how do i say i like the weather and all they will do is send me the lesson for it which is already in the beginners path so whats the point now i personally think the premium is worth it if you can afford it again to be clear the amount of resources and tools for premium is worth it i just cant justify the my teacher at this juncture for an absolute begginer

now since then ive delved into other apps such as one thats literally just called learn japanese on ios this is how i actually learned kana and now am learning kanji it is a really good app and uses srs with you setting your own review frequency on all of its basics and they have another app just or jlpt kanji level highly recommend it

rosetta stone i tried again as a beginner not a fan it starts you out on the app and the first lesson was just a picture of a woman for example the some one saying woman in japanese then man then they have you either say it or match the phraseword to a picture didnt seem efficient or like a good order of operations and the next few lessons just solidified that especially based on cost

duolingo now i actually like doing duolingo when im tired or just dont feel like sitting down and studying hard its fun but not a good way on its own unless you just want the basics really holds your hand i would like if they got hiragana and katakana out of the way then jumped into greetings and other things just my opinion 

anki  im dumb and dont know how to properly use anki to its maximum yet lol but its helpful and i like opening it and using it while im pooping or waiting in line stuff like that

another app on ios its called human japanese this one seems useful so far but at this point a lot has been review for me so cant say how good quite yet but its about as good as the other app as far as content but it adds a lot of culture notes and descriptions at to why some things are the way they are so seems better i would recommend but its only an iphone app and looks like crap on an ipad despite being locked to landscape orientation

memrise similar to duolingo i wouldnt rely on this but its fun and i like that there are native people speaking and you see how  people may say the same thing very nice but its more of a game and review when im bored and thats how i think its used best

now i have also been starting in genki but again doing these things seems to share a lot of the same content and ideas so it becomes review  not a bad thing or genkis fault that being said selentoanuri posted a site they made that acts as the workbook and that is amazing and super helpful so thank you for that

ok if anyone read this let alone this far thank you and you are awesome i am looking into immersing more as that seems to be a really good way to learn its just gonna have to be a planned out and meticulous process for me with my schedule if anyone has advice questions on anything or wants to say im stupid im opening to learning also if you want to give advice to a newbie im very open and willing thanks and every have a great  learning japanese"

does anyone have any tips as to how to make this less awkward i guess or is it okay to write the stroke from right to left since thatd be a little easier and more comfortable i know stroke order is important so i wanted to ask some people who actually knew what they were doing before i get myself used to doing stuff wrong or something like that lol

thanks in advance gtwlt"
"advise me on the merits of online courses japanese online institute community college or others i want to learn japanese well enough to speak and eventually read it i intend to seek a position as an alt and i want to already have at least a very basic level of competence in the language by the time i arrive  i want to do this by taking an actual course with lectures speaking practice a teacher to review my work etc  because of covid it has to be an online course using something like skypezoom i guess  and ive already graduated college almost exactly one year ago so i cant sign up for a course there  what are my options and what experiences have any of you had taking online courses in japanese  what would you recommend or advise against

so far i am aware of three possibilities

 taking an online course offered by a community college  this seems like the most reliable option on the face of it though also the most expensive and ive seen community college courses disparaged as basically useless on this sub  plus its hard to know before taking such a course what it will be actually like many surely must be almost entirely selfdirected and made to be as easy as possible so that one would be better off simply cracking open a textbook and teaching oneself than spending money on the course

  this looks promising to me but only if its actually what it presents itself as  i have enough sense to know that a independent organization like this could easily be a scam and that there are varying levels of scamminess  is japonincom any good  does anyone want to come forth with a story of how much or how little they learned from its classes  if its not a scam how much are the classes like real classes with lectures direct engagement between teacher and student etc

 a private tutor using a website like italki  ive seen this recommended a lot on this sub but have a hard time seeing how i could know if a tutor was any good before i hired them  surely many of the teachers on such websites are not professionally trained and dont have much idea how to actually teach a skill in itself which goes beyond merely knowing the material

 are there any options i havent heard of  mentioned here

to anyone who replies  thank you so much in advance for your help

in the meantime time to get back to memorizing hiragana"
"just an open thread to talk and share i was driving home the other day and was thinking about my studies as i just got done and i was frustrated with the idea that i still feel like i know nothing despite studding for ish months yes i know its not a lot as i was studying that day i ran into many things that made me feel like ive gotten nowhere like forgetting rules or things like colloquial phrasing using this word over this one or one way is natural and the other is weird or things like he kicked the bucket i also cant make sentences easily enough let alone remember enough grammar to make sentences off the fly im getting better when doing practice work but i still make constant dumb dumb dumb mistakes dont get me wrong im not quitting or anything but rather frustrated at my incompetence its the frustration that drives you to work harder because you know how much you need to improve

"question for people who learn by reading so im on my th month of learning right now at the beginning i learnt basic grammars and tried text books online courses wanikani etc but my priority is clear it is readinggtlisteninggtvocabgtgrammargtinputwritinggtspeaking so for  months now i have been reading every day i read blogs entertainment and news articles stories traveling articles and my reading improved a lot  

my listening and vocab has always been better than the rest thats why i want to improve reading a lot more my biggest problem though is kanji recognization as in i encounter a word that consists of several kanjis usually n and above that i dont know the reading at all but once i see the furigana i know what it means  

so my question is should i just keep reading and eventually let the words stick or should i also do some anki reviews or some kanji drills to recognize more kanji"

"as a beginner it seems i see genki recommended far more often than tae kims why to preface im not dogging on genki i thoroughly enjoyed my experience with them first two volumes for context ive been studying pretty dedicatedly for about ish years and completed genki ii about  months ago since then ive been focusing primarily on inputting conversation anki and pronunciation i decided to check out tae kims to reaffirm the basics and learn some new constructs later on and i was blown away 

the approach seems to make so much more sense the way japanese is explained in the context of well japanese how it immediately forces you to recognize simple kanji its much clearer description of particles namely は and が and the order of which it teaches certain fundamental constructs two examples of the last point being dictionary forms and qualifying noun phrases as genki refers to them and doesnt touch until late i or ii that seem to make up an incredible percentage of japanese sentences i plan to go back through tae kims from the beginning"

"which stroke order is actually correct so ive been going through the  frequently used kanji available on lingodeer and these last few days ive tried writing them down on a piece of paper rather than just using my finger to draw them in the app when writing them down on paper i check the stoke order on tanoshiijapanese to see a clearer and less stylized version of each kanji

an issue i ran into was that i noticed some minor differences in the stroke order between lingodeer and tanoshiijapanese for some of the kanji

specifically 田 and also other kanji that have the same element like 男

also 右 

ampxb

for 田 after the first  strokes on lingodeer it shows the middle stroke going right then the middle stroke going down and then the bottom stroke going right

on tanoshiijapanese it shows the middle stroke going down then the middle stroke going right and then bottom stroke going right

ampxb

for 右  on lingodeer the first stroke is the horizontal stroke right just like in 左

but on tanoshiijapanese the first stroke is the downward stroke that tilts to the left

ampxb

so for each of these cases which one is correct

im inclined to think the tanoshiijapanese version is correct both times but i dont know for sure are there disagreements over stroke order in kanji or is one of these sources simply wrong"

i can basically make out everything else but what mattaku is doing in this sentence apparently it meaning really or being used an as a saracstic version of really but i dont think either of these definations fit into the setence above i could be highly wrong

"so i took the jlpt n mock test for the first time i started learning japanese in march of last year

i never did any form of formal study i just started reading from day one yes i learned hiragana by reading manga and i didnt really do any full immersion i studied very little

i would just read mangawatch anime and fail to learn words with anki

after two months of study i tried the mock test on the jlpt website and failed to even understand what i was supposed to do so i closed it on the first question and forgot about it

today as i was having the same toughts on how im really not improving in japanese at all i remembered the jlpt was a a thing so i tried it for real for the first time and i was shocked to find out i was actually doing it then i expected to get obliterated at the listening part but to my suprise it was actually easier than the written part

in the end i got one wrong answer and that was all

now i know the n is super easy and probably the real test is more difficult

and i know a lot of people pass it a lot faster

but honestly it was a big surpise for me considering i literally never studied grammar and did nothing but read manga for very little time per day so i always assumed i was way below n

i wanted to write this because it was the first time i felt what i was doing had some sort of legitimacy and i could actually learn japanese for real i decided to try this method of study as a sort of experiment so i always had self doubts

sorry for bad english its not my native language"

"kanji showerthought a misstroke of a kanji is the same as misspelling a word in english

i mean think about it if i wrote 宿題 but without the little 人 in 宿 or maybe i forgot the top leaf radical of 百 still talking about 宿 or some of the drops in 題 or some other silly mistake in any other kanji im sure a person attempting to read it would know what i meant

of course there are certain kanji that are really hard to figure out without context when theyre improperly written like 末 and 来 and 米 and so forth but thatd be like english words that are commonly mistaken like totwotoo theirtheretheyre foreforfour etc

"has anyone made a deck for slay the spire theyd be willing to share the repetitive and encapsulated nature of the game makes it feel like a good game to get familiar to some more common words and simple grammars but honestly its mainly just that any immersion is good immersion tbh if im playing the game anyway i may as well be learning

ideally sorted by class since they have themes which too come with a smaller bubble of words

a furigana mod would have been great so i could search up these words kanji searching them is far too slow imo

"absolute beginner question how to use time and resources effectively こんにちは　worldsapathy　です

i recently began studying japanese this month and have been working on studying ひらがな　and かたかな however once i memorized the stroke order and pronunciation i began to feel lost in where to go next i noticed that on this subreddit that its recommended to learn the kana and then move to kanji at the beginning of my studies i used learning japanese hiragana and katakana nd edition by kenneth g henshall to grasp an understanding of hiragana and katakana with some vocabulary words 

i went looking for other resources to learn japanese such as genki  amp  and minna nihongo i choose to go with genki and has yet to arrive i also ordered remembering the kanji  by james w heisig to learn the kanji when i am ready for it 

i also saw a promotion going on japanesepod for their premium and saw that it had lessons for beginners however the beginner lesson just shoved vocabulary at me instead of starting me out with the hiragana and katakana   

i apologize if this is a stupid question this is the first language that i have begun to teach myself as the opportunity came up since i have a year from when college starts for me hopefully some of you can help me understand how i should take things"

"how do i understand spoken japanese better i know that listening practice is important as is studying grammar i often find myself trying to listen to a sentence or think of something to say myself but i have difficulty with naturally interpreting what is said in the order that they say it i know what each word means and what the particles mean when attached to the words but im having trouble naturally stitching them together in a sentence so im wondering how long its taken more advanced learners to get the hang of just listening to what someone says and hearing what they mean in the same way we hear someone speak english and dont need to consciously think of each part of the sentence theyve just spoken

to put it another way when reading this you dont read any word twice nor do you have to think about how the grammar in each sentence affects the general meaning of what i say im still fairly new as far as vocabulary goes i probably know several hundred words and understand most regularly used particles but i still have to listen to something more than once or consciously think about each part of the sentence before i can understand it properly so does anyone have any advice or tips for helping with this beyond just listening to lots of japanese talking"

it uses jishoorg word search with a given parameter to display  random words on your home screen  jishoorg supports a huge variety of tags that you can specify to display whatever you like  i plan to use it with jlptn but you could also have a widget displaying random yojijukugo for example with yoji  i pulled out some other interesting ones in the usage section of my readme

you can find installation instructions and all the code for it here


if you have any feedback or ideas for it please let me know on github or here  i hope someone else finds it useful or interesting"
"particles first thing first i know verbs like 好き 嫌い 欲しい is some kind of adjective verb something like  likeable hateable wantable

but some adjectives are not like that and even so it oftenly has a が before them which i think is a particle for verbs some examples 猫が可愛いです 猫は可愛いです 顔が変 顔は変 彼が可笑しいです 彼は可笑しい

why does it happen 

sorry if i did not explain my question very well"
"forgetting new and old anki vocab way too frequently what to do im aware this question has been asked a few times on here but none of the answers i found were super useful

basically the amount of vocabulary i forget everyday when reviewing anki is extremely high especially considering the ratio its like a  forgottennot forgotten
especially since including graduated nongraduated cards i only need to review about  words a day

and this applies to both older cards and cards that havent graduated yet ive tried many things to try and remedy this but none have quite worked out

 i reduced the words i study to  per day however i find that when the words start getting spaced by about a month and a half when they come back around i forget them very often

 i reduced the intervals basically seeing the cards a little more often

 i tried putting sentences on the front of the card with the main vocab highlighted

 i tried adding japanese definitions instead of english ones

the maximum interval the cards can go at is  months

 i use websites that give example sentences to read a bunch of example sentences for a vocabulary im shaky at

 before my cards graduate i have a  min  day  day reps before they graduate at  days

 my vocabulary cards do have example sentences with both vocab and sentence audio sometimes no sentence audio if i really really cant find anything
and i sometimes even add a second example sentence too

i tried using memonics especially in the beginning of using anki maybe im bad at making them but they werent that useful

 i bury cards im shaky at so i can see them the next day to make sure if i really did forget them or i just had a momentary brain fart

 i made a seperate anki deck where i copy cards i forgot to be able to review them without having to worry about the intervals being affected

i tried all of these things but even if some of them have helped a little bit or maybe even a lot i still find myself dreading doing anki each day because i know theres going to be a bunch of vocab id have forgotten and honestly reviewing a bunch of cards kind of exhausts me especially when theres so many i just plain forgot so i find myself skipping days often only to do all my reviews  being consistent for a few days then the cycle repeats

also i guess this is important but i only make cards study vocab for words i encountered while reading  watching videos etc i rarely add the sentence i actually encountered the word though because
  in the case of reading i prefer my cards and sentences have audio
 i pretty much only use anki on my phone so extracting and cutting audio can be a long process

any advice for how i can make the words stick better"

"i want your recommendations for manga on pixivコミック since ive really started to go hard in consuming native content these past few months for the purposes of immersion i dipped into the world of jp manga i finished all the content on billingualmanga a while ago and hopped onto pixivコミック which has tooons of manga to enjoy for free so much so that i dont know where to even start besides following the manga i liked on bilingual manga a few i heard about and picking up some that looked interesting and simple on the front pages

so i would like recommendations on any of the manga there on the easier side on there to have native content to read and immerse in  other sitesmanga is fine but preferably something that has pretty readable text

some of the manga ive read and enjoyed

キャプターさくら クリアカード編  seen the first series anime and the adaptation of this arc love the artwork

うちの息子はたぶんゲイ

you can probably figure out my tastes from these and an idea of what im looking for slice of life based preferably nothing depressingsad modernish setting etc etc somewhere between n and n difficulty wise preferably not a fantasy setting has a lot of made up words or a complex plot unless it has an english summary or something i can check out to grasp the context thanks"

"if youre looking for content to immerse in the piropito minecraft playthrough is not only a great resource but probably the best minecraft lets play ive ever watched playlist here 

the premise of the lets play is piropito playing through minecraft for the first time completely obliviously as he decided to play without using the wiki or without asking for any advice this makes for a very interesting nonlinear lets play as he has to discover things by himself through experimentation and accidental discovery he also has a very calm relaxed commentary without any annoying editing obnoxious yelling or sound effects at times it even kinda feels like some asmr series 

he talks in japanese and his minecraft client is also in japanese but unfortunately there are english subtitles baked into the video itself they can be useful for beginners but if you find them harmful for your immersion you can try hiding them using whatever you can eg a screenmarker such as epicpen the first videos also have nonautogenerated japanese subtitles provided which you can overlay the english ones as well

most of the vocabulary he uses is pretty easily understandable and there is context to what he is saying through minecraft it makes for great entry level comprehensible input"

i recently bought a jlpt n book to start learning japanese but since i dont know how to read it i decided to learn the hiragana chart w the dakuten and combo hiragana chart with it i started with hiragana because people told me it was the basic vocabulary for japanese then i would learn the katakana chart with the dakuten and combo katakana as well after i learned how to writereadunderstand what most characters sound like i would decide to start reading my book the book i bought came with its website and a download link for the audio of the sentences while reading i would try to say it out loud to get an idea then i would start speaking without reading speak basic things like  hello how are you whats your name my name is then i would learn kanji after i know at least  words and can formulate a nd grade level sentences

thats my plan but im still not sure about it so i need your help what did you do how did you learn it how are you learning it what is your best advice how would you change my plan

"a fast efficient and fun guide to learning japanese for all levels the other day while looking for monolingual transition resources i stumbled upon this fantastic general guide 

knowing how to go about learning japanese especially as a beginner is tough first its hard to tell what resources are efficient and which are less efficient at the same time a lot of the resources suggested are very expensive for a lot of japanese learners over  usd for the textbooks just isnt feasible 

reading through this guide i found myself impressed at just how well it reflected the problems that i faced while learning and how thorough it was it directly confronts the issues of both those looking to learn japanese by consuming media and those looking to gain as close to native affect and accent as possible 

i am not an expert i can only speak to my own experiences learning i can tell you that using near identical methods described in the guide i was allowed to skip semesters ahead in my college japanese classes from an introductory class to an intermediate one and reached a point where i can comfortably read and enjoy light novels and visual novels  

i highly recommend this guide to anyone starting out or even those who are a little more advanced"
"what other numerator suffixes like 号室 号館 etc exist in japanese in my attempt to find out how locker numbers are referred to like locker  which i still havent figured out unless its just with 番 or 番目 both of which have a lot of results on google so idk i found out that号室 for room numbers and 階 for storeys arent the only numerators but that there are also at least 号館 for building numbers 号車 for train car numbers and 号線 for road train line etc numbers

so now im interested to know if there are more is there a comprehensive list anywhere

another user on a certain forum used this term not sure if its the technically correct term

ps sorry if this has the wrong flair or if it counts as a beginner level question hopefully it doesnt but admittedly even after over a decade of trying to learn japanese almost daily my practical level is probably below someone whos been learning it for only a month i used to blame brain damage but then it turned out i dont actually have brain damage so no idea why tbh but its besides the point of this question anyway"

"when immersing how far above your level is the material that you consume one of the most common pieces of advice that i come across is that you can engage in almost anything so long as it is compelling to you while krashen states that input must be both comprehensible and compelling people like steve kaufham and matt vs japan have gone onto say that it is actually ok to consume material above i  so long as it is engaging and that online resources like yomichan type dictionaries anki and pictures if is manga can make it more comprehensible to you

normally it is best to get a strong foundation in basic grammar and around  wordsi think that was the estimate before moving on to native material that said  at what point do you stop and go nah this shit is too incomprehensible  i watch anime but i tend to stick to romance and slice of life it is above my level but i feel like there is generally a lot of i in there shows like galactic heroes and gundum are to far above my level so i dont bother

i had no reason to disagree i thought true as long as i know how to read them ill be good which was true for me for a long long time 

i spent years happily reading kanjipacked novels and manga and subtitles in japanese feeling so smart and accomplisheduntil this year when i decided to start a language diary and realized i couldnt even recall from memory all these kanji i supposedly knew not even simple ones like 飲寝歩etc l knew them but i didnt it was such a mindfuck and really embarrassing tbh 

so almost  months ago i decided to start relearning kanji and practice how to write them and recall them from memory today i can recall and write  kanji from memory which i know isnt a lot in the grand scheme of things and i dont feel like a kindergartener while writing anymore

and i know being able to write kanji isnt a test of someones intelligence but i just feltilliterate i felt so frustrated that i couldnt write a simple  sentences about my day without it looking like unreadable hiragana vomit but now im actually excited to write

"how intertwined is your englishnative language in your comprehension of japanese ive recently been focusing more time on learning mnemonics and other memory techniques to help me learn certain things better eg list of presidents in order and while it seems grand to use for these kinds of lists my main interest is tying it into my japanese studies

ive been doing japanese for  years as my major in university and while some things are burnt into my mind forever i seem to really struggle with some other things so ive seen recommendationsstories from major mnemonists when theyre using techniques to learn vocabularygrammar in foreign languages but the difference between japanese and romancegermanic languages feels quite staggering

i have confidence in myself to be able to make a memory map of kanjivocabulary and retain it but i worry its dangerous to start that behaviour in the case that it takes me longer than a native speaker to comprehend and respond in the longrun

albeit something minor like the presidentslargest bodies of water ive kind of evolved to the point i just know it without going through the journey in my head now but if i have to go from remembering the radicals of a kanji then remembering the reading then translating it in english  i worry thats too much and im overcomplicating it

"benefits of a native speaker issei keeping up their language they dont use hi all

perhaps you have some wisdom for me and those in similar situation as me i am a native japanese speaker grew up in japan and went to regular japanese schools up to th grade then i moved to the us in  and have lived here since

up until about  i used japanese regularly with other natives through exchange students working at a japanese restaurants ampc and in reading and felt that my japanese was in a pretty good shape alas writing not so much t_t its become inactive since and i could feel it eroding slowly  ive started to put some work for a couple of years now to mitigate this by reading fiction and non and watching media practicing kanji etc

aside from my personal enjoyment of reading and understanding and simply being able to communicate when i go back to japan which are all fine reasons for me are there other good reasons to keep up my japanese

i ask this because i feel like im sitting on something valuable that im not using that other students put countless hours to learn the language it seems so wasteful not to put some effort to kaizen

questionpoint  
were i ten years younger maybe i can look forward to becoming a translator an interpreter or work in japan or with a japanese companysomething that i could utilize this skill but my fulltime career as a classical musician i have no use for it to make a living at all these days i use a lot more of latin and german in contrast to japanese i have pertinent reasons to keep these up for my work also i dont see myself moving back to japanyet

i am wondering if i nonetheless kept up and improve my language there might be opportunities doing side gigs or even changing into careers that are unknown to me or would my japanese even as a native but admittedly lacking be insufficient for the real jobs what if i get certificates 資格 in  
q

cant pinpoint my exact language level but generally i have not needed a dictionary to read most fiction eg murakami banana kawabata sometimes i look up difficult kanji in older literary fiction i can see myself needing a dictionary on more technical stuff ok with either jpen or jpjp dictionaries

any wisdom much appreciated thanks yall

tldr  
native japanese live now in the us no real need to keep up the language to make a living but feels wasteful"
"how should i start learning japanese hi i have been researching ways to learn japanese for about a month and i have come to the conclusion of the following ways i should start it out 

 learn hiragana and katakana and be able to know what it is almost immediately through flashcards ill be using brainscape as a study took for them 
 i will try to use learning japanese from zero and genki to learn a bit through there ill also see the videos from learning japanese from zero to guide myself along side with the books ill also study kanji 
 ill learn how the grammer works and how to create sentences 

im not entirely sure if this will help me learn the language within  years but im willing to put the effort ill try to study  hours a day at least and look for other resources i have literally no knowledge about what things are named or what things are in japanese apart from a few phrases that i hear commonly im hoping to pass the n in about  years and be fluent without any problems im basically a baby with no knowledge if there are other ways i should do it please let me know im opened to suggestions and ways to can do things "

"ことだからvsものだから hello clever people of reddit   


another question regarding two grammar points i feel like this one i should have sat down and really worked out a long time ago i understand that こと is abstract and もの is concrete but when used in the grammar points ことだから and ものだから is where i get confused  i understand that ことだから means something like exactly because or precisely because but what would the difference be in the term ものだから   


thank you"

"is it possible to understand japanese but have little time for studying hello so lately ive been quite very lazy to study japanese from textbooks for about  weeks now   
because of me probably draining myself studying every single night for about  hours last month and most probably the reason why how i got drained from studying because im still a beginner at japanese ive only been learning it for  months now

and i havent really been studying that much but ive been watching japanese content during that duration on youtube niconico netflix and so on   


but my question is is it possible to lets say only study about an hour each day for japanese and then supplement that to watching japanese content on youtube  will i be learning japanese from that im sure i will get used to how they speak but in terms of learning words and some sentences that they say will i be able to learn from it i dont know if that made sense but yeah  


i apologize if this is a stupid answer to question but anyways thank you guys for reading"
going from vocabulary retention to spontaneous conversation im at the point of comfortably being at an intermediate level listening comprehensionwritten but as for actually engaging in spontaneous conversation i feel that im still lacking i feel like i could functionally operate through a daytoday rote conversation to meet needs and have a more formal slightly algorithmic conversation ie small talkexchanging pleasantries i want to break out of this and start getting toward more abstract expression short of total immersion not really an option right now what techniques have others used to at least start on more abstract thoughts and speech

"looking for a website similar to howtostudykorean for japanese this question is mainly oriented to users that also learn korean or might know the website  

i recently got interested in japanese language so i have been using a few resources like apps and pdfs to learn hiragana katakana the basics

i have also been looking for neat websites to learn grammar and i remembered when i was learning korean there was this great website called howtostudykorean where theres different levels with a lot of different grammar lessons from each level and also has a vocabulary list of words that come out in the lesson

it was made by a foreigner learner so some people are a little skeptical but i am essentially looking for a website similar to it but for japanese especially layoutwise since i think its very neat and easy to navigate through

i have been looking through the posts of this subreddit looking for websites to see if i could find some interesting ones and i definitely have but if i could also find one similar to howtostudykorean it would be amazing 

could anybody enlighten me a little i appreciate any help
thank you"

"found an app that rates your writing accurately you can actually see your improvement instantly brilliant its called kana bimoji japanese master by
mirai education on google play mirai seems to have more apps like this came kana bimoji on a purdue university site downloaded it after getting more and more frustrated with the mistakes skritter was teaching me but the interface of skritter is so good and it has decks from lots of popular books where you can practice writing it has a wanikani deck so i stuck with it but my writing was pathetic due to skritter teaching a mix of calligraphy style  printed form  standard handwriting 

thought i would share my discovery anybody else using this app"

"what is one to do for conversation practice こんばんは

ampxb

ive been on the journey for around  years now already and my main goal at the beginning has been reading though as time has passed ive become more interested in the other aspects conversation listening etc while finding resources and material for reading and listening can be easy enough where do i find natives or other students to speak with over the net i know wk has the japanese only boards but the posting on them seems sparse at least is the case on the beginners board which id prefer as my conversational skills are very poor curedolly had a website for this purpose but when i went there it was a ghost town any suggestions"
how to say i want to be im trying to figure out how i could say something equivalent to i want to be like  i want to be a teacher or  i want to be happy ive read that なりたい might me the best way to say that is this correct
what do you recommend i do to get better at this i have mastered katakana and hiragana with simple conversation skills and proficient with their grammatical usages  but have a lot of difficulty going for more advanced conversations i also struggle with learning kanji and have been using an ebook from japanese  with  kanji letters to learn it i also try to read japanese texts but i rarely ever understand anything it says i also try listening to japanese dialogue from youtube videos with caption but that helps very little and only because i look mostly at the caption i just want help with learning this language
"videos that might be useful for people interested in pitch accents from a native japanese speaker this is my first time posting on reddit so sorry if its structured weirdly or something im not too sure about my english either but here goes nothing

i will introduce two videos centered around pitch accents in this post
unfortunately neither of them have english subtitles however ill be glad to help anyone out if theyre confused about the wordaccentetc

 鈴木勝イントネーションシリーズまとめ
this is a compilation of moments when viewers pointed out that masarus suzuki masaru a japanese vtuber of nijisanji pitch accent of a certain word sounded a bit off
masaru then tries to change the way he says it but the viewers can only communicate with him via text chat so its a bit of a struggle
notice that the japanese subtitle sometimes puts arrows next to the hiragana to express masarus pitch accent and how the viewers try to tell masaru what the standard accent is by saying things like the pitch accent of a is the same as b 

the words introduced in this video
反復横跳び はんぷくよことびhampukuyokotobi
半ズボンはんずぼんhanzubon
半袖はんそでhansode
きな粉きなこkinako
レッドブルred bull

 暇すぎて面白いゲームする奴
the second video is a skit titled guys who were so bored that they started an interesting game played by jarujaru jarujaru or ジャルジャル is a wellknown japanese comedic duo
this video is a bit hard to explain but ill try my best
also you should keep in mind that they are talking in kansai dialect so some pitch accents in the video dont correspond to the standard kanto dialect

there are two words used in this game

the first word is かき kaki 
like many japanese words those two letters can mean a variety of things and this game takes advantage of that fact
in the game there are five possible answers all read as かき
夏期 summer term
柿 persimmon
牡蠣 oyster
火気 fire
カーキ khaki this one is pronounced differently from the other four and can be deciphered regardless of pitch accent 

the second word is はし hashi this is a famous one so most of you might already know
橋 bridge
箸 chopsticks
端 edge

during a conversation one guy fukutoku starts to get confused about homonyms and their pitch accents and asks the other guy goto how he should be saying those words the exchange goes something like this

fukutoku how do you say kaki as in fruit
goto kaki
fukutoku how about kaki as in summer
goto kaki with different pitch accent from the fruit

then it quickly escalates to fukutoku only saying the broad category of the word and goto keeping up by replying with the correct pitch accent every time

fukutoku fruit
goto kaki
fukutoku color
goto khaki
fukutoku the clam thing
goto kaki

you get the picture the same rally goes on with hashi and they get more and more excited with each round


im terrible at explaining things so again feel free to question me about anything you werent sure about"

"is there a point at which its possible to continue improving at japanese through immersionconsuming content alone without having to explicitly do flashcards or study grammar rules ive been wondering this ever since starting like  months ago when it comes to english as i am a native speaker when i encounter patterns and words i dont know usually new memes or slang i can generally get a sense of whats going on through context this occurs frequently in daily life and i dont usually have to directly look something up or study english in my free time does anyone feel they have arrived at this point for japanese as a nonnative speaker and if so at what point

i also think its possible that im overestimating my degree of independence as a native english speaker like maybe i actually just ask other people instead of the internet when i dont know something in english curious to know everyones thoughts"
