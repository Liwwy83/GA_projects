4,Korean,ive lost motivation and would love some advice on what to do  
5,Korean,"any advice for a korea to us immigrant that barely remembers korean is there any common advice for people who are relearning korean as a emigrant

me came here at  years old over  years ago parents were worried about my english so they hard prioritized english by  years old i was no longer fluent i can read very well since korean is so easy but vocab and grammar are bad

apps ive tried so far

 drops was nice for the very beginning and then their mindfulness lesson was pretty bad

 so i tried duolingo but the alphabet series is kinda bad the issue is that english letters are not nearly as specific as korean letters iirc this is why reading english can be hard for other people for example it sometimes uses oe as the romanization when they really mean something like uh or ae i can get past this if the vocab and grammar areas are good 

while searching for reviews on duolingo i found this sub and im wondering if i can hear from other people like me who moved here and forgot korean and successfully relearned

ps is there a good website that lists american shows which have korean dubs available on netflix i think this would be the best way for an emigrant to relearn"
6,Korean,if you had to choose between ttmik books vs klear integrated korean im using the online resources for ttmik and planning to purchase some of their books however ive come across so many good reviews of the klear integrated textbook for those youve used both or tried to use both which ones felt helpful to you i know part of the textbook experience is that its meant to be paired with a teacherprofessor facilitated activities rather than be used for self study whereas ttmik seems to be designed for self study

8,Korean,is the  usually spoken when its in the middle of a word i came across the word  and looked up to see what it means and how it is spelled and its spelled like weoro are some words with the  letter in the middle of them pronounced like that because when we learn batchim we learn that the  letter is pronounced as having an l sound when its at the start of a word or when its a batchim for example when a jahmo ends with the  letter and the next one starts with a consonant or when its two  letters followed by each other
9,Korean,"cant find motivation anymore if this kind of question isnt allowed please let me know and i will take it down

i have been studying korean for four years but it wasnt until the pandemic began that i began taking my studies seriously i had nothing else to do so studying became my obsession and i put too much time and energy into my daily studies and i completely ignored the toll it was taking on my mental state and my energy that led to a burnout that happened about two months ago and after that all of my will and motivation to study disappeared and the more i try to rediscover it the more burnt out i start to feel again so as a result of that i lost interest in korean

ive read online that setting proper goals for yourself can help but i cant come up with any goal that i feel like i can accomplish before i was studying because i just loved the language i never really had to think about what i was actually going to do with this language i invested so much time into learning i have a severe case of anxiety and that gets in the way of me speaking in korean even texting in korean or finding a tutor ive even written dozens of questions and posts on this subreddit just to erase them afterwards i desperately want to maintain and improve everything that ive learned in korean but now i just feel pessimistic about my future

after my burnout i fell into depression but the more i push away my passions the more depressed i feel

questions has anyone else been in a similar situation and how do you stay motivated or how did you recover from burnouts please and thank you

my only issue with continuing korean at uni is that im already doing a very workloadheavy degree and so doing korean papers on top of that may just be the icing on the cake that is my mental burnout lol however i think finding motivation to selfstudy korean will be difficult and id probably prefer a more structured course like at uni

 shouldnt one of  or  be enough here so either   or

for example  is to love right but what exactly is the radical here is it  or is it  because ive learned throughout my studies and i might be wrong that the base radical of a verb can become a noun so if  is love why do we conjugate with the  for example  in the informal low form

71,Korean,"studying tips from talk to me in koreans founder hyunwoo and korean jream from the teachers perspectives   

hi everyone 

are you selflearning korean or taking structured classes i taught korean at us universities for years before starting my online teaching journey and i realized that selflearners have specific challenges i hadnt thought of as a college instructor 

 how do you motivate yourself to keep studying 

 where do you find resources and people to practice with 

 what learning strategies worked or did not work for you

 what kind of materials are easy or difficult to find

ampxb

i sat down with hyunwoo from ttmik to answer questions from my followers and subscribers regarding the learning tips since he and i have taught korean for a long time to different target students i thought our experiences might help learners in different circumstances here is our main advice as korean teachers 

 spend more time in korean rather than with korean 

yes study grammar and vocab so that you can speak korean however that should not be the only thing you do use what you learned in meaningful interactions by making sentences writing journals creating social media posts doing your hobbies with korean videos and posts reading korean webtoons or listening to korean audio books as well as podcasts for reallife practice spend time and do things in korean 

 you need both input and output

many people only have input  learning new expressions from books people tv movies or songs it is crucial to have output in language learning if you learned new knowledge you must use it to produce your own sentences you need to apply them in another context to know if you can apply them correctly and what subtle nuances certain expressions have 

 challenge yourself to get out of your comfort zone

the biggest difference between selflearning and taking classes may be the evaluation when you take classes you have quizzes and tests that force you to intensively study and digest new knowledge whereas when you are selflearning you do not have that builtin external motivation make yourself take exams or proactively communicate with native speakers so that you must intensively study even if that makes you feel nervous if you want to push yourself

 enjoy it you are not going to lose your job

but if you are studying korean for fun as a hobby without a serious goal dont stress and just have fun we couldnt emphasize this enough find small ways to feel that youve improved and have fun with it you are not going to lose your job if you dont memorize that word thats been bugging you dont forget why you are learning korean not everything has to be serious  

you can watch our full conversations in this video  

ampxb

if you have any questions you wanted to ask a korean teacher or want to share suggestions with other learners please leave them in the comments i would love to answer them and hear your insights"
