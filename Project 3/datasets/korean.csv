i am a little confused when reading it today is just kind of slipping in there without any particle

"big realization that i hope can be a help to everyone i cannot believe i did not think of this before but i did tonight and i hope it helps everyone

i was looking at a book titled 어떻게 살 것인가 and then i thought of the 존댓말 way to say future tense ㄹ 것입니다 and i realized

all those endings like ㄹ 것입니다 ㄹ 거예요 거야 던가 etc are literally contracted forms of adding 이다 

so i remember i was really confused when people would say for instance 뭐한거야 isnt it 뭐해요 or 뭐했어요 

well 
뭐한 ㄴ 거야  뭐 한 것이야  what is the thing you did 
뭐하는 는 거야  뭐 하는 것이야  what is the thing you are doing
뭐할 거야  ㄹ  뭐 할 것이다  what is the thing you will do

other examples

이걸 살건가  이걸 살 것인가 

아 이게 지난 주에 말했던 건가  아 이게 지난 주에 말했던 것인가

내일 마트에 갈 거예요  내일 마트에 갈 것이예요

"how can i call my penpal whenever i see these questions i always say context in fact korean language doesnt have general pronoun so you cant really call the other without enough context if you know enough pronouns youll already know how to call them

the entire mail is  pages long to be honest i tried to find out how i called the other in my mail to give you a reallife example of how to call your penpal or any other notsofriend listeners in korean turned out that i didnt use any kind of you at all and i didnt notice this until now i didnt intentionally avoid using the pronoun it was just so natural not to say it the only natural situation you really call someone with pronoun is youre in the middle of a group conversation so you have to grab someones attention

im sure a lot of learners would already know you dont really use pronouns a lot in korean problem is knowing something and feeling why are different i found a good video explaining this difference

"language school in korea for intermediate to loweradvanced learners 안녕하세요 

ive been seeing a lot of questions about korean language schools in korea and there appear to be quite a few obviously but many of the ones ive seen that are short term intensive or a few months long always start at the beginner level 

im currently almost done with sejong hakdangs beginner level course and will be enrolling for their intermediate level as well which would mean id complete their intermediate by around julyish  i do plan on taking the topik later this year too but that isnt confirmed at the moment 

if i were to plan to go to korea for language school are there options for foreign intermediate learners or programmes that have language placement systems that place you at a certain level and let you start from there i dont see the point of going there and then starting from beginner again it seems like a waste of time and money but ive been looking and havent seen anything like this yet and some help would be greatly appreciated

"korean penpal used 반말 in the first letter same age  sigh hi all

all posts i write on this subreddit are due to my chronicoverthinking

a new penpal whos a couple of months younger than me has sent me a letter and used 반말 from the getgo 

now because in my native language  while we dont have intricate formality levels besides just one that we use with strangers at work older people etc  im used to being polite in my speech and it irks me when people get too familiar too soon a stick up my something maybe maybe 

i have gotten used to the importance of honorificsformality in korean after a year of being exposed to a lot of korean content so when i saw that she used informal language right away  it confused me and i couldnt really find a thread on here that would fit quite right

not that i care deeply about this particular penpal im more curious for future reference is this normal is it because im a foreigner how would you respond in 반말 as well should i bring it up with her is it considered rude knowing how to deal with such situations will help out a ton in the future 

ᕙ_ᕤ

bonus question what is considered the same age is it people who have the same korean age what if someone is a couple of months older  born in the previous year eg you were born in february  and they  in december  is it still your 동갑

thank you



and special thanks to uloveoflearningkorean for mentioning slowly and sharing all the tips its been really fun so far for those interested heres the post about the app"
"what is a 체 understanding speech levels  

when every foreign korean learner starts learning they learn about 습니다 and 요 endings as well as 반말 the foreign language materials generally teach that 습니다 is the most polite and formal 요 is used in daily polite speech and 반말 for close friends etc what the books do not explain is what these actually are nor that formal and polite speech levels are different today lets go over them and maybe expand our understanding a little bit 

first off there is 하소서체 this speech level is both formal 격식체 and respectful  polite you will likely never hear this speech level in real life absent religious texts and maybe the historical drama but here is the info

declarative speech 나이다  옵나이다  note according to the 국립국어원 옵나이다 is more humble while the former is a plain narrative 옵나이다 is also an archaic form of 하십시오체 

examples  하시나이다  읽으나이다  하시옵나이다  읽으옵시나이다

for expressing a guess intention or thing in the future 리이다 is used

example  하시리이다  읽으리이다

for recollection 더니이다 is used

for questions  interrogatives 나이까 or 옵나이까 can be used

example  어디에 가시나이까  어디에 가시옵나이까

for the imperative form this is more like begging or pleading since 하소서체 would be used for instance if you were begging god for something  the forms are 옵소서 or 소서 

example  오 나를 버리지 마옵소서

and lastly for suggesting something 사이다 should be used

example  자유롭고 공정한 국가를 건설하사이다

great thats all for 하소서체 but theres no point to memorize this unless you want to read the bible dont mind it 

next we have 합쇼체 this is the 습니다 we are all familiar with it is 격식체 formal and also polite  high respect shown towards the listener as we should all know this form i will not be going over it

after that we have 하오체 which is also 격식체 and high respect shown towards the listener this one as well will rarely be heard and seen but may occasionally be spoken among older people and can be heard in historical dramas so lets get into it

first off declarative sentences

과거  완료 av  았었소

과거 완료 n  였이었소

현재 av  오 소 으오 무엇을 하시오  책을 읽으오

현재 n  이소

미래  추축 a v  겠소 

미래  추축 n  이겠소

next the interrogative form

av  오  소 

n  이오

for the imperative form it is either 으오 or 으시오 you may see signs in korea like blah blah 하지 마시오 quite often 

to request something 으ㅂ시다 is used yep the same one you should already know 

for expressions of admiration

a  구려 와 오늘은 당신이 아주 행복하구려 

n  는구려 아 그림을 잘 그리는구려 

n  이구려  와 서울대학교 학생이구려

sometimes people use this with friends as a joke but not really that useful to memorize the last 체 that falls under being high respect or polite is 해요체 you already know this its the one using 요 at the end of the words however it is 비격식체 which is not formal language 

after 해요체 we can look at 하게체 하게체 is impolite or low respect 낮춤 but is formal how does that make sense i cant answer that but it would generally be used when you want to talk formally but in a slightly impolite way thus it could be used by a teacher addressing a student a mother in law talking to a son in law bosses talking to their employeesthis one is more common than the others weve talked about and you will probably recognize some of it still not gonna be used as much as 해요체 however 

first off declarative sentences

과거  완료 av  았었네 

과거  완료 n  이었였네 

현재 av  네 

현재 n  이네

미래  추축 av  겠네 

미래  추축 n  이겠네

next off for interrogatives we have

a  으ㄴ가 

v  으나 or 는가 

n  이ㄴ가

for imperatives we have v  게 or 지 말게

for requests we have v  세 

to show admiration or wonder there is

a  구먼

v  는구먼 

n  이구먼 

자네 is the normal pronoun for you in this form

in declarative sentences 으이 as well can be used for adjectives and 일세 for nouns

only two more and everyone should know them they are 해라체 which is commonly taught to foreigners as diary form this speech level is low respect and formal is well often times its used to talk to yourself or will be used when writing essays news articles and so on the last speech form is 해체 or 반말 which is both low respect and informal language 

how can a speech level be formal and yet low respect im still working on figuring that out but i hope this has helped clear up what people mean by speech levels there is also 구어체 and 문어체 which has to do with where its being used in speech or writing i know my mind was blown the first time i learned all this "

같은 나이라고 무조건 반말쓰는 게 아닙니다

물론 나보다 나이많거나 그런분들에게 반말쓰는 경우도 있지만 친한 경우에나 가능하고

as a korean person we learn english since very young like even without realizing we are learning english its like we do it because we do it 

moms try to teach english and schools teach us because we have to learn english

so as the result of that system almost no one actually learns english from that

ampxb

but some of them actually get interested in it and they try to learn it for real

so they go to a language school or go abroad to learn english

i used to be on online chatting apps or websites that i can find friends from all over the world to exchange language

and during that moment i think my english got a lot better especially my writingtyping lol

i also lived in europe and america for like  years so that helped my speaking skill as well

how do i say this if i was standing next to my friend for example and we were meeting someone new if i were to introduce him and say he is a student would i say 이 사람 학생이에요 or 그는 학생이에요 the reason i ask is because i thought 그 was meant to refer to someone or something closer to the other speaker so would it work if he was standing next to me on the other hand 이 사람 학생이에요 feels more like this is a student rather than he is a student

"새 해 새로운 한국어 이름 안녕하세요 여러분 in celebration of the new year and a continuing commitment to learning korean i think its time to reinterpret my name in korean and id like to ask the folks here for any constructive feedback

my name is daniel and im at the older end of the millennial demographic my 장모님 calls me 댄 which is an okay phonetic transcription of dan but its not exactly my name and it doesnt sound all that good in my opinion so im thinking about using 고대현 with the hanja 高大賢 as a koreanstyle name 

i gather that 高 is fairly uncommon as a korean family name compared to china but it captures part of the sound and meaning of my actual european last name i like this hanja meaning of 대현 it sounds better to my ear than 댄 and at least one famous actor who goes by daniel in english has it 

what im not advanced enough to tell is if the combination sounds corny or ageinappropriate or just not good or if there are any bad homophones 어떻습니까 대답 때문에 감사하겠습니다"

"a trick to remember vocabulary many people say to make sentences with your vocab words that you could use in everyday life which is very helpful but if you are lazy like me lol i have a trick

my example 초대
for me 초대 meaning invitation was very hard to memorize so i made a connection with it 대 means big i imagined wow i got an invitation for a big event when i am using my quizlets to review my vocab i think of this sentence which helps me remember the word

another example 아들
아들 means son the pronunciation is similar to idol in english not really so i made a connection with that i want my son to become an idol this has no logical connection whatsoever and i think that is why i remember it lol

after writing this i realize technically i am making sentences just not logical ones or the ones you would expect lol hope this helps if not im a bad explainer or im just weird lmao"

"not relying on translating last night i realized how much mental energy ive been expending by translating everything i consume in korean into english before allowing myself to understand it 

because so many things dont directly translate into english i understand at a certain point you have to let the translation aspect go and allow yourself to understand a concept in another language if you really want to learn it 

i also understand the importance of learning things in context now and not just learning the english equivalent of a word 

its still such a foreign concept to me but i think im starting to understand when learning a foreign language to only use your native language as a leg up so to speak and once you get the gist to forget translating it into the language you already know

has anyone else had an epiphany like this if so what was it and how did it help with your studies"

"any good sitcom type comedies with korean amp english subs the first korean show i ever watched was back in the late s when the high kick series came out i used to love those because the stories werent overly complicated or dialogue heavy it was easy to understand just in korean from the big amount of physical comedy that was in the shows

are there any similar type of sitcom style shows like that still available 

i prefer the short  minute episodes as i find variety shows and dramas are just too long and way too much is happening or the dialogue is really heavy with unfamiliar vocabulary that im not ready for yet plus i just much prefer comedies as a way to do some passive learning

if anyone has a recommendation please let me know thanks"

since i cant find one i am seriously considering creating my own custom keycap set for my mechanical keyboard it would include only the hangul characters and accurate korean translations of modifier keys does anyone know where i get accurate translations ie translations that are consistently used in south korea for these keys here is a korean keyboard layout from wikipedia here is a draft of my korean keyboard layout so you can get an idea of what i mean i have put some of the numbers in korean for example

so my questions for the subreddit are

 are there any hangulonly sets out there
 on the keyboard layout from wikipedia what does the key to the left of the space bar do hanja and to the right of the space bar hanyong
 if i use text for the number keys should i use sinokorean or native korean numbers what should i write for the number zero
 can you provide me with good and accurate translations for the following keys tab caps lock shift crtl alt command option space esc function delete home page up page down enter

when i was learning english the best way for me to improve it was actually talking with english speakers even if i cant understand or i cant speak much

like at first it was hard i used to speak broken english i just tried my best to tell them what i wanted to say

this way it makes me to listen to what they say and thats where i learn

like

them  you mean you were eating dinner so you called me now

me  yeah i mean that

then next time i say

"what has your korean learning progression been like everyone will most certainly have different answers but id love to know what kind of self realized milestones youve made learning korean partly because of my own curiosity but also as a way to gauge where ive been and where im headed and for anyone else as well  


i hear a lot of people mention these ahha moments of when they understood this or that  
those are super powerful moments for beginners and experts alike and theyre incredibly motivating too which is probably one of the most important things about it   


i wanna know about your victories big and small maybe a realization or a sudden understanding anything at all   


when it comes to studying anything especially a language its not how hard it is or even how easy its all about motivation i made sure learning korean was an emotional attachment that gives it agency gives me motivation but we still have those moments of just feeling sofor a lack of better a word   


답답해

motivation is what gets us to look at our book and actually pick it up this time to watch another educational video to write down another sentence

she told me in the beginning that i can use 반말 with her so i do but she is older than me by about  years or so i think
my initial thought was to use 야 but then i thought maybe that would be impolite since i usually see people say you should only use it with people your age or younger but from what ive seen most people say that 씨 is used with 존댓말 so i thought maybe that could be too formal calling her 언니 didnt seem right to me either as she hasnt asked me to call her that

"what is the pratical difference between 았었는가 and 던가 i get that 더 is like a referring to the past that i have experienced particle so is the only practical difference that 던가 is like do you recall while using the normal 는가 but with a completion marker before it is just more literary 

like what difference would you feel between

아 친구가 정말 그렇게 말하던가 

어제 서울에 눈이 왔는가 

어제 서울에 눈이 오던가 

the only difference i could feel is that just slapping the past tense onto 는가 feels more basic while using 던가 feels moreinquisitive like i want to know your personal experience of what happened"

"learning korean vocabulary is such a joy hi everyone

im writing to share some of my experience in learning korean vocabulary lately which i found truly amazing and enjoyable this could be quite a long post as ill try to summarize my findings as many as possible and the approaches i adopted cant be applicable to everyone but i hope this post could offer some unique perspectives on how to master korean vocabulary 

tldr there are three components in korean vocabulary native korean words sinokorean words and loanwords i also categorized my experience about learning the korean vocabulary into these three categories

 native korean words accumulating these words at the beginning is a bit difficult but after a while you will find that a lot of new words are built upon the old words which makes it a lot easier in the later stage
 sinokorean words sinokorean words become more and more important when you are touching more complicated and formal materials i dont think its necessary to learn hanja specifically but learning some basic mappings and the logic in building sinokorean words using hanjas is important in mastering sinokorean words
 loanwords not much advice here as most of these words are tweaked to adapt to the korean phonetics and sometimes the meaning is also changed a bit like 헬스 gym i dont have any useful tips here but have to remember them one by one

now lets jump to the details

just some basic backgrounds first im chinese and my mother tongue is mandarin ive spent one year at the college in the us learning korean which helped me grasp some basics of korean grammar however i found that after one year of study i can hardly read anything on korean websites and not even to mention to start a casual conversation with my korean friends which made me quite upset i realized one of the biggest problems is my limited vocabulary two months ago i decided to pick up korean again seriously thanks to the current situation ive got more spare time daily commute used to cost me more than one hour here in la and now i can spend it all on korean yeah i picked up the yonsei korean 연세 한국어 textbooks to study the vocabulary the reason that i used this book is that i learned that each level of this book corresponds to one level of topik test and by mastering the vocabulary in this series of books i can get a rough sense of at which level i am in terms of the required vocabulary for topik tests in the past two months i spent around  hour in the morning during weekdays to memorize the vocabulary in these books and spent as many hours as i want until im really exhausted on weekends after two months ive finished the first four books there are six books in total and im in the middle of the fifth book fyi im using a chinese app for memorizing the vocabulary the app has preloaded all the vocabulary in these books im not sure if there is such a counterpart in english basically this app follows the forgetting curve and every day ill start with reviewing all the words i learned in the past and then learning new words

looking back at the past two months i found that i spent the most time in the first level books level  and my speed starts to accelerate after level  i think that there are two major reasons  as you reach higher levels of korean vocabulary there are more and more sinokorean words 한자어 it is really easy for me to master these words usually just a single glance of their hanja counterparts and i can memorize the word  as similar as all the languages korean words are created following a certain logic its like lego and after you mastered enough building bricks at the early stage it becomes easier for you to handle new ones ill try to elaborate more on the first two categories of korean words native korean words and sinokorean words

 native korean words

a suffix and prefix

like in english there are latin roots that help you decipher the word there are many suffixes and prefixes in composing korean words as well ill list a few here

늦  late   

  늦잠늣late  잠sleep oversleeping

되  repeat

  되묻다되repeat  묻다ask ask again

  되감다되repeat  감다wind rewind 

참  true fragrant

 참뜻참true  뜻meaning true intention 

 참기름참fragrant  기름oil sesame oil 

새  very thick

 새까맣다새very thick  까맣다pitchdark extremely dark

거리다  continuously being in that state

 반짝거리다반짝in a flash  거리다 twinkle

i didnt realize the existence of these suffixes and prefixes until i reached around level  or  using yonsei textbooks apparently it needs some initial accumulation to enjoy the benefits of it im now keeping a note for keeping these roots naver dictionary also provides these roots as well for example you can search 참 with the hyphen in naver dictionary and it will show you all the meanings of this prefix with all the example words

one more thing id like to mention is that throughout the study of korean vocabulary you will find that 한글 is very analytical and ive been so fascinated by it another example i found recently is the use of the suffix 롭다럽다 to indicate the characteristics of something eg 자유롭다 부드럽다 at the first glance you could be confused about which one to attach however this is actually really logical back in the college korean class our teacher taught us the difference between positive vowels 양성 모음 and negative vowels 음성 모음 this is the reason why you are attaching 아 or 어요 differently to different stems when making it a polite form im not going to elaborate more here and you can find more at this link here basically 롭다 goes with positive vowel endings and 럽다 goes with negative vowel endings ive always been fascinated by such logic in the korean language and this also becomes one of the motivates for me to keep learning new words

i think the shining parts of these suffixes and prefixes will only become clear when you accumulate enough basic words and you dont need to memorize them specifically as for me every time when i encountered a new word that uses these suffixes or prefixes it just echoes with my old memories of some existing words that share these roots over time i can memorize and recognize them quickly when encountering new words

b compound words

compounds words also play an important part in building new words 

there are some forms that you will encounter quite often

 noun  noun parallel

눈  사람 gt 눈사람snow man

밤  낮 gt 밤낮

 noun  noun affilation

바다sea  ㅅ  가side gt 바닷가beach

초candle  ㅅ  불fire gt 촛불candlelight

 verb  verb

다니다  어아  오다 gt 다녀오다

 adjverb  noun

비다  ㄴ  말 gt 빈말

 noun  verb 

그네  뛰다  기 gt 그네뛰기 swing jump

i believe there are more patterns for combining words together similarly mastering them becomes easier and easier when you accumulating enough basic words 

c others

there are some other interesting findings i encountered last week i read this blog link about how consonants in words changed overtime to express a change of feelings it mentioned a phenomenon that korean words about weapons and wars are comprised of aspirated and tense consonants to express a strong feeling about them such as 총gun 칼knife 포탄bomb i got especially touched by this sentence

gtthe more wars and disasters the country is involved in the harsher the sounds used in the language

such findings can give you both a touch of the culture underneath and somehow make remembering these words easier for example last week i encountered this work 끔찍하다 which means horrible and gruesome i noticed that this word uses tense consonants ㄲ ㅉ and after knowing about how intensifying consonant expresses a strong feeling i got a better understanding of the meaning of this word

there are many interesting daily findings i encountered when learning korean words over time i got a deeper understanding of how learning the language helps you get closer to the people that speak this language and im definitely enjoying this journey

ampxb

 sinokorean words

now here comes the second part of the vocabulary sinokorean words 한자어

i remembered that i read somewhere that 한자어 takes more than  of the modern korean vocabulary and this percentage drops to around  during the daily conversation nonetheless i do think learning some basic hanja is really helpful in mastering korean vocabulary especially when you are touching on more complicated concepts and terminology  there are numerous posts in this forum about the basic hanjas therefore im not going to elaborate more the point i want to make is that i dont think you need to learn how to write hanja characters instead learning the mappings between the 한글 to the meaning of 한자 is sufficient for example 가 can be mapped to 家 in hanja which standards for home or occupation after learning this mapping you may find a lot of words that contain 가 are easier to comprehend and memorize like 가족family 작가writer 건축가architect etc 

i remembered the other day i was talking with my korean friend about the word polyhedra i havent learned this word in korean but i decided to give it a try based on the meaning of this word polyhedra literally means manyfacedbody after learning enough sinokorean words i know the mappings between the 한자 to 한글 in this case manygt다 facegt면 bodygt체 therefore without any doubt i spoke 다면체 to my korean friend and it is also the correct word in korean both of us got really surprised and this is one of the charms of getting to know some basic hanjas again i dont think you need to learn the writing of the chinese characters underneath but the mapping is useful and important in this case if you know 다양하다 this is the same 다 as in the previous word 다면체 and 면 as in 화면 체 as in 주체적 체육 this mapping will make a lot of words much easier to remember when learning korean another word i found interesting recently is 적외선 can you guess the meaning of it think about 적 in 적색red color 외 in 외국인foreigner or literary outsidecountryperson 선 in 호선line you can guess the meaning of this word this is also how we guess the meaning of this word in chinese it literally means a line outside the red what is this its infrared rays

overall i think similarly to the native korean words learning sinokorean words requires an accumulation of basic words at the very beginning and over time as you master enough of those words your abilities to understand and memorize new words become faster and faster

lastly from my personal perspective as a chinese im a lover of some 한자어 no matter in its chinese or korean form for example the word 찬란하다 as you may find in the korean drama 쓸쓸하고 찬란하神  도깨비guardian the lonely and great god i personally feel like the english translation of 찬란 into great loses its feelings but from a chinese perspective since i knew this word and knows the glamorous bright warm and positive feelings it delivers i resonate more when reading the original korean title after all similar to the point that i made previously learning a language is like touching the heart of the people behind it there is always something missing when translating between different languages and can be only felt when you speak that language 



this is a really long post as i have so much to say and really enjoy this journey while learning the korean language my major point here is that accumulation is important it really feels a bit overwhelming at the early stage but after you reach a certain level everything will start to pay off and finding the patterns is also important you probably will naturally grasp these patterns after learning enough words  and finally the korean language itself is really interesting and amazing i got so much joy and surprise when learning the language i hope my post can give all of you some encouragement to keep up with the journey  화이팅"

"take advantage of the small victories  motivation post i think this mindset applies to everyone when it comes to learning something new that is difficult or unfamiliar one of my main sources of motivation is self motivation as i began my korean journey i was always frustrated when i wasnt able to notice my desired progress but i was honestly overlooking all my small achievements when learning the korean language that mindset made me feel discouraged but soon i realize that i wasnt missing or lacking in anyway i was just neglecting something korean is about to be the fourth language i am somewhat proficient in and it took me this long  years of learning languages to realize the power of self acknowledgement i wanted to make this post to encourage new language learners korean learners and help you realize the power of motivating yourself help you to continue learning this beautiful language simply embrace every accomplishment big or small it could be memorizing a difficult word make a grammatical correct sentence and etc acknowledge it and have that inspire you to do more

ampxb

so i have been learning korean for four years now and now currently in the dense intermediate phase i speak  other languages for better context i am able to converse in short and midrange sentences level  ttmik i am mostly selftaught and watch loads of kdramas to help with listening and comprehension

my brain requires structure so my learning has been most enhanced with color pens and paper on my th notebook now i find it easy to pick up new vocabulary and can recall them easily but theres just been this overwhelming pressure when speaking like my brain freezes to string the words together without sounding like a lovestruck prepubescent teen in front of their idol i can definitely trace the bulk of this problem to being selftaught currently i use ttmik koreanclass howtokorean and practice speaking with one of my korean friends but i want to take it to the next level so i can overcome the learning curve  


which brings me to my question sorry for the rant has anyone used sayspeaking or say korean  i am considering going for the day course but considering how much of a splurge this is  i wanna make sure they are really as good as their ads claim i am well aware that  weeks aint enough time to make me spit korean like san e but hope to be able to construct sentences well i like that they utilize senior citizens as teachers  


and if anyones got tips to help me be more fluid with speaking please share

"slowly experiences about  months ago i wrote a post slowly app detailing how i had begun to use the pen pal app slowly for korean practicelanguage exchange yesterday i earned a stamp on slowly that i had written  letters this is amazing to me because all of my letters have been written in korean or both korean and english but always korean and i had been wondering recently how many i had written since i have been using slowly for a few more months now i wanted to share some things and hear about others experiences

 i expanded my profile details it now has  short paragraphs in korean repeated in english
 i recently had to turn off accepting new friends because i have numerous pen pals that i have had long communication with and want to put my energy into maintaining that correspondence
 there have been a few koreans who have dropped english entirely and only communicate with me in korean because they say my korean skill level is really good i think they overestimate me and are perhaps just excited to communicate with someone beyond a beginner level but i digress except for one letter this has not been an issue 
 that one letteri got a  word letter entirely in korean that was a rant about korean and american politics that flew way over my head i tried to decipher it as best i could even tried copy and pasting it into papago to try to get the gist and finally had to respond that my korean was not advanced enough and would they be so kind as to also write in english they never responded but i am not too upset about that tbh
 importantly with the majority of my pen pals we write the letters in both korean and english and then give letter corrections for the last letter sent so i correct the english in their last letter and they correct my korean in the last letter through this i have been able to correct a few mistakes that i have been making for awhile and importantly by practicing these corrections in my letters i have been able to get the corrections to stick

okay i am incapable of making a short post apparently lol my apologies i would love to hear about the experiences of other korean learners using slowly"

today i struggle with vocabulary and sometimes grammar but overall seem to have an okay grasp of grammar without having to think about it or knowing the underlying grammar rules 

id like to be able to focus my continued learning around efficiency with the objective of being able to have more indepth speaking conversations writing emailssms with the help of spell check i definitely think my studying should focus around vocabulary but think it might sense to also learn grammar rules and sentence structure 

should i forego grammar i dont care too much about grammar being incorrect as long as i can speak relatively fluently any recommendations for study resources im thinking about trying out talk to me in korean but would also like to supplement with books

"what goals did you set for yourself when you first started i know this is very subjective and everyones learning abilities are different but im both curious and trying to look for a baseline for myself

for instance did you give yourself a week to learn hangeul how much vocab would you learn in a month how long did it take you to become fluent

im just starting and learning the alphabet but im a bit lost as to what to expect im a very impatient person who wants things fast  which i know its impossible when learning a language 

also i just watched a youtube video of a girl whos been learning for  years and she says she still isnt able to understand korean songs or dramas entirely this discouraged me so much because  years sounds like an eternity maybe im just setting my expectations way too high"

이가 좋아요 and 좋아해요

im from korea and its my third question to you guys on this sub

when i was learning english i wished i have a local friend who natively speaks english

but i see some people want to learn english but dont actually have no plan to make friends who speaks english

like language is to communicate but some people dont actually have that idea of utilizing the language in real life they just learn english as a skill

i mean i respect that the idea above is just my personal opinion but im just wondering

so basically i learned english to talk with foreigners because its usefulthat i can enjoy reddit as well lol and fun

but if i wasnt interested in foreigners foreign culture travel english websites i wouldnt have learned english because i have no reason to learn

"beware of translationese featuring 당신 im a native speaker who has been on this subreddit for some time and today id like to share something that has been bugging me recently

korean being a language with a rich history of being translated into the very first hangul text was a translation of a classical chinese text also has a long history of a peculiar style of speaking and writing called translationese 번역투 translationese is a style of the korean language that arises from translations of foreign texts and speech and it is very distinct from how koreans use the language in daily life let me show you some examples and discuss why translationese is so prominent in korean

 original text i hope my explanation helps you
 natural korean translation 제 설명이 도움이 되었으면 좋겠습니다
 translationese 제 설명이 당신을 돕기를 희망합니다

why is the last sentence translationese because 당신 is used which is only used in very special circumstances and 희망하다 to hope is an overly formal sounding word for this situation basically no korean will say that sentence to another korean in daily life

then you would be asking why did this happen if no one says it like that in real life why translate it that way that is because it is so much easier to translate to translationese than to naturalsounding korean if you look closely it is a wordbyword literal translation of english

 제  my 설명  explanation 당신  you 돕다  to help 희망하다  to hope

so it is very easy to make translationese sentences when translating whereas it is harder to make natural translations where you need to paraphrase the sentence and come up with an idiomatic way to express the same idea and translated media being so prevalent in korean society and there being so many mediocre translators it wouldnt be an exaggeration to say that most of the literature that koreans encounter in daily life is in translationese

since this style of writing being so pervasive in korean society people actually started to write original korean literature in translationese too the reason for this could be that people just got too used to translationese that they started to think its part of the literary style of korean or it could be because translationese sounds more convincing and like it has more authority but the thing to keep in mind is that it is yet to seep into koreans daily speaking style this is important translationese is still mostly contained in formalsounding literature and in movie dubs now here comes the problem

when a person speaks our brain automatically and subconsciously adjusts our speech to be best understood by the person we are talking to for example when you talk to your grandparents you will tend to avoid using neologisms and internet slang to help them better understand what you are saying the same thing happens across language boundaries too there is a welldocumented case of english teachers in japan altering their english pronunciation and simplifying their grammar to be better understood by their students for example they avoid connecting words naturally eg pronounce what do you think wordbyword instead of connecting them naturally like whadayathink and avoid contractions eg always say going to instead of gonna

this happens to a korean speaker when talking to a foreigner too specifically ive noticed a lot of especially young koreans have a habit of using translationese when talking to foreigners this could be either a conscious choice or a subconscious effect the reason for this could be that koreans think westerners would understand better if they spoke in translationese which is as stated above closer to european languages pragmatics and grammar another reason could be that their brain switches to westerner mode when faced with a westerner so you start to think in translationese instead of idiomatic korean either way this could be harmful to a korean learner if their goal is to achieve naturalsounding korean speech

for example a korean learner will learn that 당신 is practically never used in daily life and then realize everyone is using it to them because koreans are speaking in translationese to them ive seen many learners be confused by this and argue that 당신 is used a lot in daily life when actually it is not so that is why i wrote this to give you learners a headsup"

"looking for help defining some slang i wasnt sure if this is more of a cultural question or language question so i hope this is a fit here

im looking for help identifying and understanding what i think might be a particular korean slang word my boyfriend native korean speaker shared the translated version of this word with me nonkorean speaking american learning during a conversation but was unable to define it and i didnt think to ask what the actual korean word was until i got curious later so i wanted to share the context of the conversation that brought it up to see if anyone here could help me identify it 

i was sharing with my boyfriend some concerns about a girl who i felt was kind of sneakily flirting  marking territory around him i gave him some examples one being of her and i hanging outside together alone where she asked if he and i had been seeing each other for about  yrs and i said yes we went inside shortly after where she saw my bf and loudly declared i cant believe weve known each other for five years and hugs him

at this point of the story it clicks for him and my boyfriend says ohh youre saying shes a fox im confused and ask him to explain which he says its a korean term for this kind of lady or behavior

"listening practice in korean hello

so far ive been listening to spongemind and their slow korean conversation replaying parts that i dont understand over and over again i tried listening to some korean talk shows and some kpop vlogs like loonatv but they talk way too fast i also often get stuck in listening because a word comes up that i dont recognize and i sometimes dont have a transcript to refer to ive also kind of been recording myself and playing it back a few days later

im really bad at explaining so im sorry if this isnt making sense basically im not really asking about how to use the grammar correctly but im really interested if theres a reason this difference exists in the first place

also if anyone knows any other resources about this kinda thing please drop me a link because im super fascinated by it"

"slang question suffix ending words in 누 지리누 미쳤누 배고프누 etc meaning and possible negative connotation tldr what is the slang 누 suffix and does it carry a negative connotation socially

its common in online communities to see comments like 님 미쳤누 학교가누 그걸 어떻게 하누 with the slang 누 suffix

what does this mean there are no sources that i can find

i believe it is just to make the sentence more funny or friendly but im wondering if it carries a negative connotation or association like the slang 노 suffix eg 군침이 싹도노 is  although being just a suffix from a dialect  negatively associated with the infamous website 일베일간베스트 which is an online community full of socially unacceptable posts because the people who use 일베 write their comments in the 노 even if they dont use the dialect this has been cleared up though and you will probably not be called out as an 일베충 if you use 노

i dont think its something negative but im not sure i just want to make sure im not using something that is bad

on ttmik i learned that verbs are not conjugated based on person if somebody is eating the verb is 머거요 it doesnt matter if i eat he eats she eats they eat its always 머거요

but i have seen on pimsleur and rosetta stone that when talking to somebody else 하세요 is used for example 한국말 하세요 but when talking about myself 해요 is used for example 네 한국말 해요  


could somebody please help me understand why"

 im having trouble with this conversation

"update  id like to have a free korean lesson session with zoom with you guys hey guys thanks for the comments

ive read all your comments and now im trying to organize the thoughts

so i guess its gonna be in  foams

   for the people who dont want others to hear or dont wanna speak in front of other people
 multiple  its gonna be a small group so everyone gets time to speak and learn
 livestreaming  i teach what you guys ask on chat or any of you having a  conversation with me and stream it so other people can just watch or listen

ampxb

and some of you wonder why i want to do it and not even getting paid from it

the reasons are 

 if i want to get paid i gotta satisfy you i will have to be responsible for it  
not that i mean im not gonna be responsible about it but its a whole different story once i get paid for it  
like i can just give you a pizza i made and i dont have to care whether you like it or not you eat it or throw it away  
but if i get paid to make a pizza for you then i will have to remake it if you dont like it and i will have to listen to your specific order like what you want on the pizza  
of course i can teach you what you ask me and i can do what you tell me to do without getting paid for it but thats as long as i want it  
basically i dont wanna be forced to do something and i dont wanna be a scammer  
read the number  you will get what i want to do  

 i enjoy it   
as i mentioned im not gonna teach you grammar or those boring book stuff what i want to do is conversation ill start the conversation i want you to talk about something real from your life even though its something very boring to you like i live in arizona and theres a lot of cacti here and jesus today i broke up with my boyfriend because he a jerk  
if you are a beginner then you can speak in english and try korean as much as you can i will help you  
if its hard to talk about stuff then i will help  thats the thing  
and im gonna also tell you guys my life story in korean and english as well if you are beginner and if its hard to understand for you i will explain and make you learn  
im not a teacher im a korean dude that you can talk to and by that you learn korean  
i enjoy having conversations and livestreaming kinda thing  
basically i wanna do something that can give me and you a laugh and a good day
 i might give lessons to a few people who actually want the lessons from me in the future if things goes well  
but thats not gonna be like the number  above thats gonna be like ill ask you what you wanna learn or improve and i will take my time to prepare to help you out preparing the sources arranging time for you and make sure you are satisfied with what you get

ampxb

"tip for a x beginner who cant make progress despite not having trouble with other languages first i have tried learning korean multiple times over the last  years  not kidding  each time i go nowhere

im not bad at languages  im not even bad at sov structure with comprehending japanese much beyond the basics

ive watched more korean tv than anything else  unlike with japanese i dont learn new words when i watch korean tv

ive listened to more korean songs than anything else  unlike with japanese i dont learn new words when i listen to korean songs  i even read along with the lyrics  i can even sing along with the lyrics

when i do learn a korean word it doesnt stick in my head  theyre not clear  im wholly sure this is because of my ear not being able to distinguish similar sounding letters

ive done all the things i cant think of  audio lessons  tv  tunes  books  talking to koreans lol that goes nowhere cuz of my shit pronunciation  what am i missing  im not bad at languages  im bad at korean

fwiw the only people i know of who didnt have a hard time learning korean were not native english speakers  maybe its a clash between english sounds and korean or something  its foolish to assume all languages are the same difficulty for all people eg ukrainian is easier for a russian speaker than an english speaker

for those of you in america who have learned or made progress in korean what have you done and was it different than when you learned other languages

is there a point after which you get it  or is the level of difficulty continuous  for example you might say korean was really hard for me until my brain comprehended the phonemes and then i got it  or you might say korean was really hard for me until my conceptualization adapted to so many two syllable words and then i got it

thank you"

i watch kdramas and listen to kpop every day but the level of those is just too high to pick up new things

reviewed a lesson in full korean for the first time ive been studying korean for about  months now but i was too scared to learn grammar in korean today i was reviewing 으ㄹ 수록 and i stumbled upon this video i clicked on it because i found the thumbnail funny then i was surprised that it was in korean the teacher was so enthusiastic that it kept my attention and i was so surprised at myself that i actually understood it im been on a slump lately in terms of learning so this definitely is a good progress marker

"any book recommendations on how korean grammar is fundamentally constructed does anyone know a good book that explains how korean grammar structures are well constructed

for example the structure 으ㄹ 텐데 is constructed through the combination of 으ㄹ 터이다 which expressses a future situation or intention to do something and 으ㄴ는데 which expresses background information or state of affairs related to what is to follow in the sentence

the grammar books i use korean grammar in use explains this on occasion but not always and i would love to learn the real building blocks of korean grammar as it helps me a lot to know when i can use a particular construction as my korean is slowly but surely getting better i also want to steer away from the mindset of translating the grammar constructions and move towards understanding them properly through its actual foundation

if anyone has some book recommendations for this both in english and korean is fine please let me know"

"why should i learn korean over latin 라틴어 대신 한국어를 배울 것으로 하면 더 좋겠습니까 note originally posted on rlatin but realized that the answers were heavily biased i want to know the another side of the question here goes

i like both however i dont want to stress myself learning both at the same time plus i have more important things to do school getting into college etc i plan to take a stem course in college specifically computer science

im a teenager who already knows some latin and korean i dont see how im going to use korean since i have zero plans of travelling to korea on the other hand classical latin has zero native speakers so no matter which country i move to it wont be useful to me

but though korea may have seoul latin has my soul

i guess what im really trying to say is why should i learn a great old dead language over a living language

another option is to drop language learning completely focus on the real world and then come back to it in who knows when

you may know next to nothing about me but nevertheless i humbly beg your thoughts

additional note thats not in the original post i have zero korean relatives or relatives who know koreans

이 질문은 rlatin에서 먼저 올렸지만 받았던 대답들이 평향된 것 같아서 여기서 올리는 것으로 하면 더 좋은 생각인 것 같습니다 원본 포스트는

저는 둘다 언어를 좋아하지만 둘다 동시에 공부하면 스트레스를 많이 받을 것 같고 더 훨씬 중요한 것들고등학 대학입학시험 대학이 있습니다 저의 전공 선택은 stem이고 특정한 선택은 아마 컴퓨터공학인 것 같습니다

저는 한국어와 라틴어를 약간 아는 대 학생이고 한국에 갈 계획이 없어서 한국어는 저에게 어떻게 유용할지 잘 모르는데 반대로 생각해보면 라틴어는 원어민이 완전히 없어 아무 나라로 가면 고대라틴어가 유용하지 않겠습니다

한국은 서울이 있으며 라틴어는 저의 영혼소울이 있습니다

아마 간단하게 물어보면 현대어 대신에 고대 위대한 사어를 배우면 어떻게 좋겠습니까

셋째 옵션은 언어 공부를 완전히 포기해 현실에 집중을 하고 미래서 언어 공부를 다시 시작할 겁니다

저를 잘 아시는 분들이 아니시지만 겸손하게 여러분의 의견을 잘 부탁드립니다

"tips for studying korean so i havent really been actively studying korean but i try to passively learn as much as possible i watch a lot of vlogs on topics i enjoy on youtube and also watch random shows while im on naver 

during december i started reading a lot of webtoons like 나노마신 내일 오늘도 사랑하세요 겟백 정글쥬스 and 전지적 독자 시점 can you guys tell i really like challenging webtoons  i just find them the most interesting some of these ill read in korean and read again in english if i ever find a site that posts them in english but most of the time when i find a vocabulary or grammar point in them that i dont know ill write it down and learn them in context with extra example sentences for further context that i get from naver dictionary and try making sentences with them later on during a review session i feel like ive really improved while using this method 

i also try to go onto twitter since i have two accounts and ill just scroll through my fully korean account and talk to my mutuals or just see what they were saying i think this is one of the ways i learn a lot of slang and natural ways of texting too


my plans for the new year is to get back into actually actively studying it properly everyday please free to drop some tips or your study habitsschedules to help me on my journey"

"reading aloud vs reading in head i noticed recently that when im studying example sentences or reading dialogs in my textbook i have to read it aloud or at least mouth the words in order to get through the text at a reasonable pace whenever i try to read   in my head without vocalizing i often find myself having to go over the sentence  times in order to even comprehend what its saying 

for some background id consider myself an intermediate learner im at a level where im reading webtoons and childrens books  but i just cant read them without mouthing the words under my breath

in terms of language ive always been more of reader than speakerlistener since childhood in english and my mother tongue and remember transitioning from reading aloud to speed reading at a pretty young age so i guess this reading aloud issue is probably just part of the learning curve for korean or maybe its just me 

curious if you guys have a similar experience for those of you who eventually learned how to read silently without vocalization how did you get there and were there any methods that helped you"

my problem is this i found a source which says that the original hangul scripture was published in  by king sejong it was originally included in a document called hunminjeongeum haerye which the writing system was originally named after in the document there was allegedly also a manual for how to use the alphabet etc 

okay but 

since the main aim for the invention of hangul was to teach ordinary people with little education how to read and write how did the ordinary people actually get ahold of a copy of this script and how did they learn how to use it when they didnt know how to read in the first place 

i tried searching on both google scholar and regular google but couldnt really find the answer

"third times the charm this is my experience with language tutors feel free to add your experience with language tutors in the comments ω

so far i had  language tutors for korean but they were unsuccessful the main problem was that they thought i was taking the exam  topik when i was learning korean for fun 

 the grammaraddicted teacher
this teacher was recommended to me by my cousin so i could not read how many students she has the reviews she had unlike the other tutor on italki 
this teacher is not a native korean speaker but rather a taiwanese married to a korean
after we finished pronounciation she moved on to a grammar book korean grammar in use the problem is that i could learn grammar by myself and could not actually practice speaking by myself when i requested her to make the lesson more conversationbased she ignored my request and continued 
when i asked her some time later i was sick of grammar she said 
i teach grammar if you dont understand please find another teacher
so i quit her

 the teacher who quit me
i did not actually quit this teacher but rather she quit me she said her learning method did not match me and said that she wanted to focus on her regular students i taken  lessons with her then
this teacher i emphasised my goals in the contact teacher form and asked her to assess my level in korean 
she focused more on conversation which is great but the thing is most of her students use her for exam prep 
she focused too much on topik prep 

im going to try my third teacher on italki  days later wish me luck "

i started learning korean when i was  got through the basics pretty well i had all the time of my life to learn and so i think i did i stopped  months after and never studied again but i was able to retain the knowledge i have since i kept watching korean media now im  and i would say that i have learnt more vocabulary and grammar points from all the media ive watched throughout the  years ive stopped studying for real i can read and write pretty well have a decent amount of vocabulary learnt and can listen to korean well due to quarantine ive decided to get back to learning as i have gotten the interest i had then back i would say that i am over the beginners phase and am more of in the intermediate level

"없어 pronunciation slang i know kpop songs shouldnt be used for educational purposes but ive heard a specific pronunciation of 없어 a couple of times now so it might not hurt asking 

they sometimes say it more like 없으 without really the ㅡ at the end eobs its very unusual to hear because in korean you normally cant have an s sound at the end of a syllable actually pronounced as an s without any vowel after 

examples are

blackpink  마지막처럼 as if its your last 
in the second verse there is the word 어이없어 pronounced that way

and

fx  hot summer
first verse after first chorus 재미없어 also pronounced as stated above 

so im just wondering if this is just lyrical style or if this pronunciation is in fact used in spoken korean as some kind of slang or something and if its the latter when is it used and are there any other similar examples"

"talking with close friends who are older than you i have a few questions regarding closeness with people older than you by a few years where is the line i want to make sure im not overstepping any boundaries

ampxb

 친구 can i even refer to them as my 친구 in the first place because 친구 is the same age 
 욕설 can i swear with or at them as a joke not seriously i can imagine this one will be touchy
 honorifics can i just call them 님 is it weird or disrespectful
 other is there a substitute for 야 do all 친구 need to be 동갑

ampxb

put into some context

 친구 can i call or refer to them as my 친구 they have called me their 친구 before but i dont know if that means i can do the same or if its traditionally even acceptable would it be okay for me to say something like 내가 님 친구라매 어떻게 나한테 그래 or 우리는 친구니까 그럴 수 있지 or refer to them as 친구 like 아 저 형 그냥 내 친구임 etc
 욕설 욕설 can i jokingly use profanity swearing is a big part of friendships and closeness in my age group calling a close friend 개새끼 or 병신 시발련 as a joke etc is used for very light insulting level of like you little shit and also as endearment sometimes but as 동생 i cant call them those even as a joke right im really stuck on this one and honestly feel kind of left out as the only one someone suggested that things like 이 등신아 지랄하지마 might be okay but not the 쌍욕 jokes
 honorifics for the friends that i am particularly close its kind of offputting to call them 오빠 for some reason it sounds cheesy i call them 님 it came from how my closest friend whos two years older than me used to call me 님 how people refer to each other in anonymous online communities despite knowing my name and age in kakaotalk text messages and just 너my name in real life so i just called him 님 too and it became a habit since 오빠 is kind of 느끼해 and 오글거려 seriously is that just me i feel more comfortable calling friends 님 if they are a close friend i even call my 동갑 friends 님 now from time to time but is it weird or disrespectful first off you only use 님 online usually and it might be disrespectful not to correctly use their honorific but 님 isnt 반말 like 너 either
 other when i call them i wish there was something else i could say rather than __언니오빠  or 님 which 동갑 friends have 야 but i cant use that is there something else also is it just me who thinks were friends in 형 동생 friendships do both parties see each other as friends or just 친한 형 and 친한 동생

"sharing a few tips after my first month of learning korean hi rkorean folks

for the past month i have been studying korean about  hours per day this subreddit has been really helpful to me so i wanted to share some quick tips that have helped me in my first month of studying korean

i was already at a novice level of korean as i am a koreanborn gyopo from canada immigrated at a very young age however my korean needed serious work so i decided to swallow my pride and put in some deliberate effort to improve

my goal for this year is to be able to have natural freeflowing conversations with natives with near perfect pronunciation and grammar this will be a huge feat for me

some things that have been helpful to me so far

study by watching korean variety shows

this is huge for me each day i watch a minute clip of a korean variety show on youtube and dissect the words and phrases spoken by people on the show listening to natives speak to one another is helpful to understand how the language actually sounds in a real world setting 

whenever a word comes up that i dont understand i look up the definition and write it down it is key to not just watch passively but actively by pausing and writing down definitions practicing pronunciations etc i make flash cards out of these words and they tend to stick better because i have context

find a korean native to practice with on hellotalk

hellotalk has been very helpful for pronunciation grammar and speaking practice i noticed my speaking practice was a big obstacle for me as i have limited opportunities to practice speaking korean living in canada

i decided to try hellotalk and its been a game changer i met a korean native on there and we have a call each day mf for  minutes to  hour its mutually beneficial for the first half of the call we speak in korean he fixes my pronunciations and awkward sentences in the second half we speak in english and i do the same for him

my hellotalk buddy has helped me make big strides in my pronunciation and has made me a more confident speaker overall

use quizlets mobile app

quizlet has a great mobile app that you can use to play flash cards in the background i listen to my sets when walking exercising or doing chores around the house the apps pronunciation of korean words is pretty good also so it does a nice job of reinforcing pronunciation and vocabulary at the same time ive tried anki but i like quizlet much more

celebrate the small wins

its easy to get frustrated and feel like youre not making much progress i feel this way from timetotime however i have learned to celebrate the small wins like when i find myself understanding a new phrase on a variety show or when i read a youtube comment written in korean that has words that i recently learned

tldr watch korean shows find a native to practice with use quizlets mobile app and celebrate the small wins

going by this meaning i understand how its used in the following sentences

 나는 우리 집을 나무로 지었어

 저는 그것을 영어로 할 거예요 side question is this really 할 or is it meant to be 말

however i dont get how its used for the following sentences where you want to indicate what you had for your meal

 저는 아침식사로 밥을 먹었어요  i ate rice for breakfast
 저는 보통 점심식사로 과일만 먹었어요  i usually only ate fruit for lunch

if we go by the meaning indicated earlier why is 으로 attached to 아침식사 and 점심식사 instead of 밥 and 과일 respectively from what i understand did the subject not carry out the meal with the food they ate so why is the particle attached to the meal itself instead

"pronouncing double consonants after spending a very long time practicing i have finally mastered double consonants

it was hard because i could never figure out how to hold the sound before letting it out if that makes sense

ive seen other people struggle with this too but i found a very simple trick that i think will help but im not a native so please let me know if somethings wrong



if youve learned korean sound change rules youll know

ㅂ  ㅂ  ㅃ

ㄱ  ㄱ  ㄲ

etc

for example 십분 gt 시뿐

basically if you know how to pronounce ㅂ ㄱ  ㅈ as 받침 you can add another one after it and say it

for example

아까  say 악 then 가 가 here sounds more like ga

오빠  옵 then 바

i also realized this from a comment in this post

from the comment
the word hot dog is pronounced with a double consonant

핫도그  your tongue stops after saying 핫 and then when you say 도 it should sound like 또

translation help 
"translation help im translating a romance comic and theres a scene that shows an interaction between two characters lets call them character a and character b character a says to character b the following b is 기자

근데 기자님 정말 못한다 귀엽긴 한데 다음엔 연습 좀 해와요 다음이 있을진 모르겠지만  and character b thinks

웃기는 소리 하고 있네

even though i got some translation help i still dont understand what character as implying i gathered this

근데 기자님 정말 못한다  by the way youre really bad at this

귀엽긴 한데 다음엔 연습 좀 해와요  its cute but please do some practice for next time

다음이 있을진 모르겠지만  i dont know if we meet again though

웃기는 소리 하고 있네  what nonsensebullshit

but i dont see a logical chain here first character a says 귀엽긴 한데 다음엔 연습 좀 해와요 but then they counter it with 다음이 있을진 모르겠지만 they ask b to practice but they state that this day may never come

is 다음이 있을진 모르겠지만 some kind of openended statement to leave b to decide if they want to meet or not or are they implying that bs so bad that they dont want to see them ever again hahaha the pictures in the comic dont help either because theyre just as ambiguous

so id appreciate if someone explained all of this to me"
"advanced learners  what is one piece of advice for intermediates you wish you had known or practiced earlier lately ive been trying a variety of things  watching shows reading webtoons novels chatting with penpals i realized i shouldve started reading books much earlier on lots of repeating vocab so many words whose meaning i can just guess from context clues and just generally more exposure to the language but in a very enjoyable way

also how would it be for college how do you say freshman sophomore junior and senior in korean would it just be 대학교  학년 or are there separate words for that like in english do we have to say the 대학교 part or can we just say 학년 because i think ive heard people say just that but it makes me think of grade  grade school rather than year  college although it should be obvious of course haha

"rap battle to memorize a great tip for learning if youre comfortable with your vocab and want to solidify it or just want to start connecting more dots

rap battle to create rhymes and connect thoughts my friend and i legit did this for hours and had a blast because some of the connections were hilarious and it gave us both a chance to exchange language and memorize it well

 pick an ending sound 이 려 or something like this

 go back and forth and create sentences or rap battle like rhymes to memorize

example if were using 오 as the ending sound

어디 사는 거 주소
make sure to review it 검토
죽을때 후 산소
산타 말하는 거 호호
느리게 하는 남자 slomo

and so on

ive taken two beginner korean college courses the next set would be intermediate i amp ii but i graduated so i cant just easily go sign up for those classes 

i still have my college books and use anki to enforce remembering the vocab i learned i can read but the subjects are very limited and im tried of the limits im not the best at listening but it is better than speaking my speaking is shit no one to talk to yay tried using hellotalk and tantum but it either goes

"going backwards is really going forwards i would just like to give my piece on something i have been thinking about recently in the hopes that it helps other learners

often times people get so stuck on the terms intermediate and advanced you end up thinking if you can learn some extra special vocab and really advanced grammar points then you will be an advanced learner so you open up your grammar book and flip to 으로 말미암마 or ㄹ지언정 or any other variety of rarely used grammar points in an advanced korean textbook you study them for a while and then make some sentences upload them onlineand theyre right but everyone says theyre awkward

yes this is the true distinction and what makes one an advanced learner not knowing a whole host of pointless grammar seriously why tf did i study ㄹ지언정 but making oneself sound natural unfortunately learning this takes a looooot longer than studying grammar and vocab 

so what i wanted to say is dont feel down if you feel like youve hit a brick wall obviously it would be great if we could all talk about the chinese civil war or whatever like we were writing an essay in our mother tongue but thatsactually not that important you can talk about even relatively difficult topics in simple terms to become more natural at korean forget about 쓸모 없는 grammar and vocabulary and go back and review the things you think you know you might know it but not really know it

it might seem like going backwards and it might feel terrible at firstbut learning to speak naturally is _the biggest_ help to ones skill a sentence can be  grammatically correct but sound totally awkward working on that wish i had started earlier probably the only time ill ever use ㄹ지언정 is trying to write some poetry or somethingdamn"

so i thought pork and 고 even though porn is not a verb 기가 wtf is 기가

then i realised it was 돼지고기가 pork meat even when writing this post the browser had no problem splitting the word right down the middle it would never split english words like that

is this commonplace in korean is there a way to know if the word on the next line is a continuation its hard enough as a beginner to split a word into the actual word and its particles let alone having to glue split parts back together "

i have a problem which im very anxious about and also pretty embarrased to be honest
im finishing my rd and last year of studying korean at university but i am very bad at speaking its very hard for me to think in korean and form sentences i generally have a big problem with conversations and i know that after these almost  years of studying i should be speaking much better 
and to be clear we dont talk much in out classes the teachers are not best generally the course in my uni is very poorly prepared but its nearly the end for me so im going to finish it anyway
but im looking for some advice how can i improve at speaking do you know any apps or fun sites to talk with other people or maybe ways to learn just by myself"

"how would you make example sentences in korean without the o of the sov  can it be done i have no idea is the title is right but i needed something to put ok

i know that a lot of time at least where i live people will make example sentences and will omit the ending part of the sentence instead of saying something specific to avoid being wrong and just to show their examplemain point idk if theres a name for this  

im going to make a lil example to help possibly understand better 

lets say theres a guy you know whos always choosing what to do without consulting other people before hand and so you always have to do what he thinks is fun instead of all agreeing on something as a group when complaining about him to a friend that doesnt know him you say hes always like yeah lets go the the and then the and the what about the right after yeah sounds fun right

but if you were to say something like this in korean it would be different or you wouldnt be able to do it at all because place에서 comes before the verb 

i know in movies when words pop up a few seconds after the rest of the sentence it is to help build suspense i know its also done in korean but how would that be done in convo is it just being silent for a second mentioning movies as jus an example bc i feel like the two situations are similar

hopefully tht made sense ahh sorry this is so long "

so i was thinking about saying grace before a meal saying a short prayer to bless the meal whenever you sit down at the table by yourself or with familyfriends

i did some searching and came up with some set catholic prayers but my wife says they sound unnatural she grew up in the korean presbyterian church 장로교회 which is the biggest noncatholic denomination in korean she wrote out a couple of prayers that she says sound natural i thought i would share them with yall and if you have any feedback or suggestions i would love to hear them

"the many usages of the auxiliary verb 싶다 todays grammar is understanding the many usages of 싶다 

the many usages what do you mean you just stick it behind 고 and it means you want to do something you might say i wish this were the case butit is not  and today i want to go over those so we can all work em out together and gain some knowledge 

 동사  고 싶다  i want to do x verb should be simple enough right 

 동사  형용사  이다  나  ㄴ가  는가  다  ㄹ까  군  almost anything 싶다  thinking wondering about something ones thought or impression about something

아들이 중국에 유학한다니요 정말 컸다 싶네요  did you say your son is studying in china wow he must be  i bet hes  he seems all grown up now

걔가 한국어 잘하더라 한국 사람이 아닌가 싶었는데 캐나다에서 태어났대  hes good at koreani wondered if he was korean but he said he was born in canada

가끔 외국어 공부하는 거 정말 좋아하나 싶다는 말이야  what im saying is sometimes i wonder if i actually like studying foreign languages

 동사  ㄹ까 싶다  this one is the same as ㄹ까 봐 except it can only be used with 동사 and not 형용사 im not sure why that isbut apparently thats the rule means you are worried about something becoming a reality

시험에 떨어졌다는 메일이 올까 싶어 걱정이다 

살이 찔까 싶어 헬스장에서 운동하기로 했다 

거절당할까 싶어 아무 말도 하지 않았다 

 동사  형용사  이다  았었으면 싶다  like 았었으면 좋겠다  you wish for something that probs wont happen 

김현아랑은 사귀었으면 싶은데 true story

이번 방학 때는 여행했으면 싶다

 동사  ㄹ까 싶다  same as ㄹ까 하다 an intention to do something

다음 달에 시애틀에 살고 있는 친척들을 방문할까 싶다 

올해는 한국어로 된 책을 읽을까 싶은데 추천이 있나요 

bonus 듯싶다  this one is technically not 싶다 itself and is a separate auxiliary adjective related to 듯하다 but it contains 싶다 so why not this one is basically like a formal 것 같다  it seems its probably its likely i bet etc probably you will never use this one it sounds kind of awkward irl 

그는 다짐을 깬 듯싶다 

현주는 옷차림에 신경을 쓰는 듯싶다 

so there you go lots to dissect with 싶다 but it will be worthwhile and i hope this is useful to you"

 ex 친구하고 영화를 봤어  something like this would be translated as i saw a movie with a friend even though the word i doesnt appear  i made it up apologies if im wrong

i speak english and spanish and in those languages there would be no issue saying i you etc

"why i stared learning korean earlier today on rkorean i posted  korean grammar concepts  one of the comments seemed a little out of place to the point that i felt i should write a separate post on who i am and why i am learning korean

my name is abhi and i am the founder of bentolingo i am an engineering physicistturnedlanguage lover i started learning korean  years ago before i started learning korean i also learned chinese and japanese you can read more about it here why you actually need a reason to learn a language my segue into learning korean like hundreds of others here was through music and friends  

why korean

i was born in india before i moved to the states for my education so i never really thought i would end up learning chinese japanese and korean one day  let alone just korean 

anyway so you see before i started bentolingo i ran a language services company linguavista so when i was working with linguavista i was fortunate to meet with and got to develop acquaintancefriendship over emailskype with our korean translators and clients in  i traveled to seoul to meet my korean friends for the first time in my life and i fell in love with the city the cuisine and the language head over heels i left korea with the determination that i must learn to speak korean and understand korean culture closely 

so i started learning korean just like how i learned chinese  not just through books but through friends music tv shows and yes apps in a year or so i started falling for kpop and before you know that was my soul music i probably listen to kpop more than any other genre of music now the problem i faced using apps or even books for that matter is that they are either focusing too much on vocabulary grammar and recognition of native alphabet or are simply trying to teach the same thing all over again level by level 

my focus was to converse in korean if i can write and read  all the better but my first and foremost question was can i hold a conversation can i speak korean can i get myself out of sticky situations can i ask for help when needed this led me to start bentolingo after my company linguavista was acquired i decided to focus on getting an mba from the ohio state university any buckeyes here during my time as an mba student i was taking my classes in the morning and working on my app in the night i actually got around launching the app in beta last year

why bentolingo

so i didnt want to make another language learning app with flashcards quizzes vocabulary builder and so on i wanted to connect native teachers with learners so that the learners can learn korean in a more casual setting without the pressure of knowing vocabulary andor grammar that is where the idea of a bento box came in bento or as you know dosirak in korean is known for its customization and convenience and on bentolingo our chefs teachers create language learning content faster and in a more efficient way than say on youtube instagram or facebook learners purchase bentos at their own pace and more importantly practice their pronunciation from the first wordsentence

bentolingo isnt meant to be a language tutoring app or a language game app i tend of think of our vision as social language learning app we are still building out features and our business model  so we will make mistakes along the way but its a team of collaborators and teachers from different cities in the world  ranging from la to seoul who create the content on the app so that you can learn simple practical and relevant words and sentences to listen speak and build your appetite and holding a conversation this is more than a founder or a developer sitting and monetizing an existing dictionary in the veil of a language game  my vision is a little more ambitious and i am creating a social language learning movement with bentolingo 

anyway so this is my story i am happy and grateful to be a part of this community i look forward to learning more about what are the problems being faced by other learners in this community what can i learn from others and most importantly  how can i help others in this community if you like my story and want to know more please message me and upvote me if not you can still find me here on this subreddit posting about korean language learning this is a great community and i thank you for letting me be a part of it lets keep on learning korean and encourage each other to help everyone in this community to learn korean 

thank you for your time to read this and its nice to meet all of you 좋은 하루 보내요

"country names in north korean would anybody have a list of names of countries in korean looking for north korean vocabulary here i just found out that north korean has its own words for country names most of which are transliterations of the original name of the country rather than the english borrowing very typical of south korean here are some examples

뽈스까  bbolseukka instead of  폴란드 pollandeu for poland which is how the name of the country is pronounced in polish polska

로씨야 rossiya instead of 로시아 rosia for russia more like the russian name россия rossiya 

도이칠란드 doichillandeu instead of 독일 dokil for germany again more like the actual german word deutschland

메히꼬 mehiggo instead of 멕시코 meksiko which definitely sounds more like the spanish word méxico

and 에스파냐 eseupanya instead of  스페인 seupein for spain which also sounds more like the original name españa

i am definitely digging this more than the south korean words borrowed from english if anybody happens to have a complete list ill really appreciate it if you can share it"

a 말뭉치 is basically a massive collection of texts taken from all over that you can look through you can search the word you want and any text that includes that word will show up this includes all sources in korean and thus is a great way to see how koreans use a word 

learning by context is no problem when its a common word you want to learn but its a lot harder when the word is not as widely used how are you supposed to learn by context when youve seen the word like  times in  pages of reading thisthis is where the 말뭉치 proves its usefulness



give it a try

for example in the link above dkdkj goes through some words in idol by bts that i didnt think about when i was first listening to the song a few years ago like 얼쑤 ursu apparently  얼쑤 is a korean exclamation associated with traditional folk music who would have thought this would have made way to st century kpop boy band one day i didnt know that 

anyway i find this quite fascinating that there are youtubers who dissect the lyrics and take time to explain the meaning behind the words sentences and culture i wanted to see if anyone else out here follows a similar youtuber to not just sing along but actually understand the lyrics with explanation  and if it had any impact on your understanding of the korean language and culture any suggestionsrecommendations would be appreciated

firstly the iyagi i have completed  podcasts at the beginning i had to take a break after an hour because my brain started to hurt now it takes a few hours before my brain starts to hurt so there was certainly still improvement there failing to reach a goal does not mean you have incurred no benefit along the way my mistake with these was not working on them every day i will elaborate on that later and instead having to do a few days where i worked through  podcasts in one day 

secondly the book i had previously read the bts book in this same series without difficultly so i falsely assumed this book would be around the same level welp the massive vocabulary difference made it much more difficult i know a lot of kpop related vocabulary since i have a high interest in that in contrast i do not know a lot of vocabulary pertaining to the film industry which caused me to struggle with this book i had planned and was attempting to read it extensively when i attempt it again i will have to take an intensive approach or a split intensiveextensive approach

so where did i go wrong with the above goals that i failed to reach them not being consistent daily and underestimating the difficulties of the tasks

 lets talk success 

i successfully completed my tutor and journaling goals 

with the tutor i paid for a package of  lessons in advance so i was going to use them having one lesson a week was a good way to have something set in my schedule and the lessons were relaxed speaking practice so i enjoyed them immensely 

with the journal  of my  journal entries were written in the first  days of the month so within the first  days i had already completed my goal for the month the th journal entry never received any feedback despite being posted on the th the  previous ones all received feedback 

so where did i go right with the above goals that i met or exceeded them money investment i put money into the lessons so i was definitely more inclined to stay on top of them completing the writing goal within the first few days gave me a sense of accomplishment which allowed me to exceed my goal only by  entries but as someone that can really struggle to journal i am happy with that

 lets talk modifications

goals and priorities change i still want to learn the songs in mots but right now i am listening to a lot of other music by different artists as well diving into the songs myself as opposed to following a breakdown provided is more fun even though it is more work i have also wanted to create a korean blog for awhile and this project was conducive to it the blog is merely a way for me to keep things organized and have a better visual of my progress for myself 

ampxb

 lets get real

if i had to describe my studying over the past month with one word it would be haphazard that is not a good word to sum up ones studying reason being i could go a few days doing hardly anything to knowing i was behind on my plan and studying  hours for a day or two in a row then back to barely anything as a perfectionist and someone who knows the importance of consistency i am well aware this was not a healthy practice so why was i so sporadic this month when i am usually so good at being consistent welp depression and anxiety i said wed get real 

i love learning korean it brings me joy and i am passionate about it but as someone who struggles with anxiety and depression on a day where i am struggling to be kind to myself studying is simply not a priority my health is even as i write up this report i am struggling with feeling disappointed in myself but i did my best in the moment and that is all you can ask of yourself some days my best is an entire day of immersion some days my best is watching a few idol videos i can only ask for my best in the moment and know not pushing myself when i am struggling will allow me to recover and be able to do more in the future

"efficient schedule for beginners i have only been learning korean for a couple of months but i often go into long hiatuses because i lose motivation and feel like i still have an infinite road to walk

"difference in use between 되다 and 하다 i have tried googling this but the answers are all over the place and maybe that is the case because 되다 is such a versatile verb

i want to know what the difference is in usage and how i can know which one is applicable to a situation purely by definition 하다 is to do and 되다 is to become the latter one being a concept that isnt really done much in english hence my confusion i have the impression that 되다 is maybe more passive

here are  examples that i find difficult to read naturally

 what someone says dont do it as a response to someone saying they are going toare doing something the korean response is often 안 돼 instead of 안 해 is the idea here to say it should not come to pass
 from itzys song wannabe  난 그냥 내가 되고 싶어 translated as i just want to be me but if 되다 means to become is this sentence then about the present or the future or continuing the present into the future

again im looking for a deeper understanding into the difference and when i should expect which one"

"korean journey pt a few months ago ive posted here that i was on my first month of studying korean and i could say that ive definitely improved starting out was one of the difficult things since you still need to test the waters and check out which method will be helpful for you for instance ive tried studying korean for the whole day while there were times wherein i dont since i have to study languages as well so here are some useful tips for you all and i hope that this would help you too

tip  find the reason why youre studying the language

this is the main thing when studying a language what motivates you will be your source of inspiration whenever you get burnouts or when you feel like youre not progressing for instance it could be kpop korean culture while for some it could be to create conversations with natives or even read korean books

tip  dont be afraid to test different resources

what works for others may not work for you so you should definitely try to check out different resources others may find htsik very overwhelming yup i definitely thought it was like that at first while for some they may not like books and prefer websites this is a tedious but necessary process since it will benefit you in the long run i am currently using ttmik kgiu and kms 

tip  korean media may help you as well

ive seen tiktoks wherein they only studied korean by watching a lot of korean dramas and believe me that is true my sister who has been watching kdramas for a long time was able to respond to my questions or sentences when i first started out learning korean  watching vlogs variety shows or movies are really useful as well

tip  find someone to practice with

a native would be highly recommended but if you have siblings or friends you could ask them as well practicing with yourself is helpful too but itll be difficult if you wont try communicating with others

at this point i could say that my korean skills has really become better but there are times wherein i still need to brush up my skills dont be afraid to make mistakes as well because itll help you along the way too 화이팅 여러분 열심히 공부하세용 "

"i think my speech impediment is aiding me in my pronunciation of the ㄹ consonant ive had a minor speech impediment for the entirety of my life my speech impediment is called rhotacism rhotacism is a speech impediment that is defined by the lack of ability or difficulty in pronouncing the sound r
i have the ability to pronounce the sound r 
what i do is i slur and mispronounce the sound r my rs tend to come out sounding like a combination of r and l when i was a kid my mom and i discussed it and ultimately decided i didnt need speech therapy it truly is pretty minor and it doesnt cause me much trouble at all mostly i tend to get some very interesting assumptions about my accent i tend to get europe australia or the east coast of the us as being the place im from im actually from the state of michigan in america ive also gotten a lot of men im a woman tell me that they think my accent is hot cute sexy adorable etc etc which hey okay ill take that over mockery or rudeness any day 
but i digress
well now that im learning korean im finding that rhotacism is very helpful in pronouncing ㄹ because it is so often exactly that a combination of r and l one of the apps im using to learn korean has me listen to a word or sentence and then record myself saying it and i can play it back and i can hear that im pronouncing it correctly 
i was actually mildly worried that i might have trouble with the pronunciation of ㄹ when i decided to embark on learning korean 
but its obviously the opposite which i find pretty astounding my speech impediment actually turned out to be a help rather than a hinderance 

i know this is a total long shot but is there anyone else here with rhotacism who has discovered what i have"

"how mnemonics can help you memorize korean words 안녕 im a huge fan of using memorization techniques for learning foreign languages and theyve served me very well in korean so far so today i wanted to give you some examples of creating associations my favorite mnemonic device so you can use them while learning vocab

video version if someone prefers it 

example   매일  everyday

starting off simple you can associate this word with emails after all youre probably getting them everyday so a simple sentence im getting mail everyday gives you the rough pronunciation of the korean word 매일 mail and its meaning everyday right next to each other

example   빠르다  to be fast

of course this technique also works for verbs i love this association basically just think of the fast and the furious movies youve got the rock vin diesel and jason statham in them as i say in the video  bald people in fast cars after i associated bald with 빠르다 i just cant get rid of it from my brain

example  수박  watermelon

this one is very fun imagine a subaru car with a watermelon in a bag in the driver seat connect those syllables in uppercase remember that theres a watermelon inside and thats it for me this technique makes memorizing words a piece of cake

alright i hope this will help you in any way if youve got any questions you can ask me or see the video where i provide more examples happy studying"

but i just learned that 지다 means to have a quality  and click basic dict

so that makes me wonder am i correct to assume that 지 by itself does not have a negative meaning and instead it turns a verb into a quality and then 마 or 않아 turns it negative as in i dont want to have the quality of crying and do not have the quality of doing that

then 지 않아 would mean that quality no

and if that is correct what does 마 really mean i found it very hard to find a definition that fits none of them mention not doing something but i did find evila barriera difficulty so then i could imagine that 하지 마 means the quality of doing that is evila barriera difficulty thus implying that it should not be done
